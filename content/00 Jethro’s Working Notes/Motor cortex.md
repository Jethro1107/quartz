# Motor cortex
The motor cortex consists of 3 key areas:
- Primary motor cortex (M1, precentral gyrus, [[Broadmann's area]] 4) - Executes motor functions via the [[Pyramidal system]].
- Supplementary motor areas - responsible for planning and sequencing of movement
- Premotor area (Premotor cortex) - responsibe for integration of sensory and motor information.
### Primary motor cortex
The primary motor cortex *executes motor functions*, via the pyramidal tract.
[[The motor homunculus roughly deleniates a map of repertoires of movement in the primary motor cortex]].
