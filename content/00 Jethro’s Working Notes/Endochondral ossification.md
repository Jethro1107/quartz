### Endochondral ossification

Endochondral ossification involves a hyaline cartilage template being erroded and replaced by osteoblasts producing osteoids.

    In a preformed hyaline cartilage, the cartilage becomes calcified with death of chondrocytes.
    
    The perichondral tissues becomes the periosteum, osteoclasts come in to degrade the cartilage matrix. 
    
    Simutaneously, an osteogenic bud carrying osteoprogenitor cells and blood vessels penetrate into the degraded cartilage, forming a primary ossification centre in the diaphyses.
    
    Osteoprogenitor cells differentiate into [[Osteoblast]]s and secrete osteoid, overlying the calcified cartilage, forming primary bone, which is remodelled into secondary bone.
    
    Secondary ossification centre forms at the epiphyses after birth (0-5 years old), which ossifies the cartilage at the epiphyses, leaving the articular cartilage and the [[Epiphyseal plate]] that enables elongation of the long bones.
