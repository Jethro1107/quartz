### Biochemistry of bone and cartilage

The biochemistry of the extracellular matrix determines its mechanical properties and function (Form determines Function).

### Biochemistry of bone

The extracellular matrix of [[Bone tissue]] is highly specialised, called the [[Bone matrix]], consist of mineralized osteoid, acquired through the [[Biomineralization of bone]].

### Biochemistry of cartilage

The extracellular matrix of articular cartilage is called the [[Cartilage matrix]]. You would expect the composition of cartilage matrix to differ from the bone matrix becomes they are required to perform different functions. An important features of cartilage matrix is the [[Proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans]], which gives it its compressive resistance.

Degenerative changes of cartilage underlies many diseases:

- [[Osteoarthritis (Degenerative joint [[disorder)]]]]
- Compression disorders - [[Degenerative change in intervertebral disc underlies disc herniation]].
