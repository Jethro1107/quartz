# Sphenoid bone
The sphenoid bone is an unpaired bone that forms part of the cranial base of the [[Neurocranium]].
### Location of the sphenoid bone
The sphenoid bone is bordered anteriorly by the ethmoid bone, and posteriorly by the occipital bone.
### Parts of the sphenoid bone
The sphenoid bone consists of the body, and paired lesser wing and greater wing extending superolaterally, and paired pterygoid process projecting inferolaterally.
##### Body
The sphenoid bone is located medially, and houses 2 air sinuses (sphenoid sinus) separated by the nasal septum.
##### Greater wing
THe greater wing can be viewed laterally of the cranium, which articulates with the [[frontal bone]], parietal bone, [[Temporal bone]], and [[Zygomatic bone]].
##### Pterygoid process
The pterygoid process is further divided into the medial pterygoid plate and the lateral pterygoid plate.

### Features of the sphenoid bone
##### Lateral features of the spenoid bone
The sphenoid bone is marked by the pterygomaxillary fissure, which is located between the lateral pterygoid plate and the maxilla.
It encloses the pterygopalatine fossa, which houses:
- The pterygopalatine ganglion
- The sphenopalatine foramen, which enables the passage of the sphenopalatine artery (a branch of maxillary artery)
##### Inferior features of the sphenoid bone
The medial and lateral pterygoid plates can also be viewed inferiorly.
It is also characterised with 2 foramens:
- Medially, the foramen ovale for the exit of the Mandibular nerve, a branch of [[Trigeminal nerve (CN V)]].
- Laterally, the foramen spinosum for the entry of the middle meningeal artery (a branch of the maxillary artery).
