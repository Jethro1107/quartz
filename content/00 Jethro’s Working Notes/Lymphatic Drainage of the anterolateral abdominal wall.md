# Lymphatic Drainage of the anterolateral abdominal wall
**Superficially**, superficial lymphatics above the umbilicus drain into axillary lymph nodes, while superficial lymphatics below the umbilicus drain into the superficial inguinal lymph nodes.
**At a deeper level**, deep lymphatics drain into the parasternal and diaphragmatic lymph nodes.
