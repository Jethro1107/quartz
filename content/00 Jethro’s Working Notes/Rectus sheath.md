### What is the rectus sheath?
The rectus sheath is an aponeurotic sheath that encloses the [[Vertical muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall#Rectus abdominis|Rectus abdominis]] (and pyramidalis), derived from the aponeurosis of the 3 [[Flat muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall]].

### Oraganization of the rectus sheath

The rectus sheath, for most of its length, completely encloses the rectus abdominis, where below a transverse line drawn between the midway of the umbilicus and pubic symphysis (*arcuate line)*, it only covers the anterior surface of the rectus abdominis, i.e. The rectus abdominis has a anterior layer and posterior layer up until the arcuate line.

**Above the arcuate line…**
The anterior layer above the arcuate line is made of the aponeurosis of the external oblique and the anterior part of aponeurosis formed by the internal oblique.

The posterior layer of the rectus sheath is made of the posterior part of the aponeurosis formed by the internal oblique, and the transversus aponeurosis.

**Below the arcuate line…**
The rectus sheath only covers the anterior aspect of the rectus abdominis, consisitng of aponeurosis of all 3 flat muscles.

As a result of the disappearance of the posterior layer of the recuts sheath, the rectus abdominis is in contact with the transversus fascia.
