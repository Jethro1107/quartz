There are 3 key neural areas that carries out motor functions: 1) [[Motor cortex]], 2) [[Cerebellum]], and 3) [[Basal ganglia]].

### [[Motor cortex]] executes its functions via the [[Pyramidal system|Pyramidal tract]]
- [[The motor homunculus roughly deleniates a map of repertoires of movement in the primary motor cortex]]
- [[Pyramidal system]]
### [[Cerebellum]]
### [[Basal ganglia]]
- [[The basal ganglia initiates learned motor patterns or coordinates parallel or sequential motor patterns to accomplish purposeful tasks]]
- [[Defects in basal ganglia do not cause paralysis, but deficits in initiation, pattern, speed and rhythm.]]
