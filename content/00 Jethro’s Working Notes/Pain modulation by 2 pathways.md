# Pain modulation by 2 pathways
There are 2 pathways by which we reduce pain sensation: 1) **Descending pain modulatory pathway**, and 2) **Gate control theory**.
### Descending pain modulatory pathway activates the spinal opiate system
Higher centres stimulate the [[Midbrain]] periaqueductal gray, which stimulates the medial **nucleus raphne magnus** of the medulla oblongata, which houses serotinergic neurons.
The nucleus raphne magnus produces serotinergic projections through the medulla to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.
The l**ocus cereleus nucleus** located dorsolaterally of the [[Pons]] houses noradrenergic neurons, which project to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.
##### Serotonin and noradrenaline activate an opiate system at the spinal level
Serotonin and noradrenaline activates interneurons, which release enkephalin, which has effects at the presynaptic terminal and postsynaptic terminal.
- At the presynaptic terminal, it inhibits the release of glutamate and substance P.
- At the postsynaptic terminal, it causes hyperpolarization of the 2nd order neurons.
This blocks relay of pain signals from the Type A-delta fibres and type C fibres to 2nd order neurons of the spinal cord.

### Gate control theory describes lateral inhibition of pain signals by simutaneous tactile sensory signals
Type A alpha or beta fibres from various [[Somatosensory receptors#Tactile receptors and the stimuli they detect|Tactile receptors]] may result in lateral inhibition, by activation of inhibitory neurons that inhibit 2nd order neurons of the [[Pain and the pain pathway|Pain pathway]].
This is why rubbing the skin near painful area can result in pain relief.
