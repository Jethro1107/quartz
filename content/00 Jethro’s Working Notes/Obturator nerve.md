### Obturator nerve

The obturator nerve is formed by the anterior divisions of the anterior rami of L2-L4. It lies deep to and medial to the psoas major, between the psoas major and the pelvic brim, and leaves the pelvic cavity via the obturator canal ([[Gateways to the lower limb]]).
- ************************In the thigh************************
    Once the obturator nerve emerges from the obturator canal, superior to the obturator externus, it gives off 2 branches:
    - The anterior branch, which passes between the adductor brevis and adductor longus, provides:
        - Motor innervation to the medial compartment of the thigh, except the adductor portion of the adductor magnus: **Pectenius** in 20% of population, **adductor brevis**, **adductor longus**, and **gracilis**.
        - Sensory innervation to the medial side of the thigh.

    - The posterior branch penetrates and provides motor innervation to the *obturator externus*, and descends to supply the *adductor portion of the adductor magnus*.

	- Obturator nerve is rarely injured due to its deep position.
	- It will cause leg to swing out when walking due to paralysis of adductors/medial compartment of the thigh.
