### Barrett Esophagus

- **What is Barrett Esophagus?**
    
    Barrett esophagus is a complication of chronic GERD and prolonged [[Reflux esophagitis]] that is characterised by *intestinal metaplasia in the esophageal stratified squamous mucosa (typically at distal end of esophagus).*
    
- **Pathogenesis of Barrett Esophagus**
    
    The esophageal stratified squamous mucosa is sensitive to acid. Prolonged reflux esophagitis causes metaplasia of the stratified squamous epithelium into intestinal epithelium with goblet cells.
    
    This makes the esophagus more resistant against gastric juices.
    
- **Gross pathology of Barrett Esophagus**
    
    On endoscopy, Barett esophagus is recognised as *salmon patches* (reddish patches) that extends upward from the gastroesophageal junction (OGJ), replacing the normal shiny, whitish esophageal mucosa. *Biopsy and histological confirmation is required for diagnosis of Barrett oesophagus.*

- **Histopathology of Barrett Esophagus**
    
    Barrett esophagus is characterised by the intestinal metaplasia in the esophageal stratified squamous mucosa.
    
    There is intestinal glandular formations with large numbers of goblet cells.

- **Complication of Barrett esophagus**
    
    The greatest concern of Barrett esophagus is that it confers an increase risk for development of *esophageal adenocarcinoma* ([[Neoplasia of the esophagus]]).
