### TCBS medium differentiates Vibrio species

A key difference in biochemical properties between the two common Vibrio species, [[Vibrio cholerae]] and [[Vibrio parahaemolyticus]] is the ability to ferment sucrose.

Vibrio cholerae is a sucrose fermenter, resulting in the formation of yellow colonies.

Vibrio parahaemolyticus is not a sucrose fermenter, resulting in the formation of green colonies.
