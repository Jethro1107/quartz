### Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is caused by haploinsufficiency caused by a Loss of Function mutation in RUNX2

Loss of function mutation in RUNX2 results in haploinsufficiency, resulting in insufficient [[Osteoblast]] differentiation.

- ************************************************Clinical features of CCD************************************************
    
    Aplastic or hypoplastic clavicle
    
    Scoliosis
    
    Delayed closure of cranial sutures and fontanelles (holes in the skull in children)
