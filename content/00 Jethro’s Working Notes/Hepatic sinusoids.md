### Histology of hepatic sinusoids

Hepatic sinusoids are sinusoidal/discontinuous capillaries located between the plates of hepatocytes in a [[Classical hepatic lobule]].

The endothelial cells consist of large fenestraes, and consist of a discontinuous basal laminae.

The fenestrated endothelial cells and the plates of hepatocytes are separated by the [[Space of Disse]], where exchange of material occur.
