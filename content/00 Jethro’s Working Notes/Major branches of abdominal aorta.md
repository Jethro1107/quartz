### Origin and bifurcation of abdominal aorta
As the thoracic aorta descends through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm (T12), it becomes the abdominal aorta, which bifurcates into the two common iliac arteries at L4.

### Major branches of abdominal aorta
The abdominal branch consist of 3 unpaired anterior branches, 4 paired lateral branches and 4 paired posterior branches:
3 unpaired anterior branch - celiac trunk ([[The celiac trunk gives rise to 3 branches]]) , superior mesenteric artery ([[Branches of superior mesenteric artery]]) and inferior mesenteric artery ([[Branches of inferior mesenteric artery]]). These branches provides the [[Arterial supply of the abdominal viscera]].
4 paired lateral branches - inferior phrenic arteries, middle suprarenal arteries, renal arteries and gonadal arteries
4 paired posterior branches - 4 paired lumbar arteries
