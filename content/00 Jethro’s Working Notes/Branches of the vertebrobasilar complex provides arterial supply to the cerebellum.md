# Branches of the vertebrobasilar complex provides arterial supply to the cerebellum
The **basilar artery** branches to give the superior cerebellar artery and anterior inferior cerebellar artery, while the **vertebral artery** branches to give the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.

The **superior cerebellar artery** (SCA), which runs along the superior cerebellar peduncle, supplies the superior aspects of the cerebellum.
The **anterior inferior cerebellar artery** (AICA),which runs along the middle cerebellar peduncle, supplies the inferior aspects of the cerebellum.
The **posterior inferior cerebellar artery** (PICA). which runs along the inferior cerebellar peduncle, supplies the inferior aspect of the cerebellum. *It should be noted that the PICA also contributes to the paired posterior spinal artery* (See: [[Arterial supply of the spinal cord]]).
