# Ribavirin
Ribavirin is an anti-viral drug that is used for the [[Pharmacological management of Chronic Hepatitis C]].
### MOA of Ribavirin 
Ribavirin is a guanosine nucleoside analogue, and has several mechanism of actions:
- It stimulates Th1 host response for viral clearance
- It inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPHD), resulting in the depletion of GTP, thus inhibiting RNA replication.
- It serves as a RNA mutagen, increasing mutation rates of HCV.
