The cerebellum is part of the [[Motor system]].

### Associations of cerebellum with other structures
The cerebellum forms the roof of the [[Ventricular system#4th ventricle|4th ventricle]].
Superiorly, the cerebellar hemisphere is separated from the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere by the [[Dural folds are present with the cranial meninges#Tentorium cerebelli|Tentorium cerebelli]].
On its anterior surface, the cerebellum is connected with the [[Brainstem]] by [[Brainstem#^9f2fd1|Cerebellar peduncles]].
### Isolated cerebellum and its surface anatomy
##### Anterior surface
- The cerebrum is characterised by the **vermis** that separates the cerebrum into the left and right cerebellar hemispheres.
- It is characterised by the **flocullus** and the **nodulus** (vernus at the level of the flocullus), that defines the flocullonodular lobe.
- Inferiorly, it is characterised by the **cerebellar tonsil**, which has *major functions in balance and equilibrium*.
##### Separation of the cerebellum in a vertical axis
The vernus separates the cerebellum into the left and right cerebral hemisphere.
##### Separation of the cerebellum in a horizontal axis #FC 
The cerebellum is separated into the **superior lobe** and **inferior lobe** by the primary fissure (not well demarcated).
It is further separated into the **flocullonodular lobe** at the level of the flocullus and nodulus.
### Vascular supply of the cerebellum
[[Branches of the vertebrobasilar complex provides arterial supply to the cerebellum]].
