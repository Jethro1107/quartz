# Femoral triangle
### Anatomical position of the femoral triangle
- Superiorly by the [[Inguinal ligament]],
- Laterally by the medial border of the Sartorius,
- Medially by the lateral border of the adductor longus.
Its floor is formed by iliopsoas, pectineus and adductor longus.
Its roof is formed by the skin and fascia.
### The femoral triangle houses many structures    
From medial to lateral, the femoral vein, [[Femoral artery]] and [[Femoral nerve]].
Note the relatively anterior position of the femoral artery relative to the femoral vein.
