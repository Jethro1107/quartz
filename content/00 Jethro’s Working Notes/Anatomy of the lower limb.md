### Bones and joints of the lower limb

The bony framework of the gluteal region includes the [[Pelvic girdle]] and the head of the femur. The pelvic girdle articulates to the axial skeleton at the [[Sacroiliac joint]], whereas the left and right girdle articulate with each other at the pubic symphysis (cartiligeous joint).

The [[Hip joint]] serves as the articular site between the femur and the pelvic girdle.

The bony framework of the thigh includes the [[Femur]], [[Patella]] and the proximal ends of fibula and tibia. Important joints in this region include:

- [[Knee joint]]

The bony frameworks of the leg includes the [[Tibia]] and [[Fibula]]. They are connected at the [[Tibiofibular joint]].

Important joints in this region include:

- [[Ankle joint]]

The bony framework of the fut include the [[Bones of the foot and the arches of the foot]]. Note the [[Subtalar-talonavicular (STTN) [[complex]] complex]] and its associations with [[Ankle inversion and eversion injuries]].

The arches of the foot are supported by [[Plantar ligaments that support the foot arches]].

### Muscles of the Lower limb
[[Muscles of the gluteal region]]
[[Muscles of the thigh]]
[[Muscles of the leg]]
[[Intrinsic muscles of the foot]] 

### Innervation of the Lower limb
[[Lumbosacral plexus]]

### Blood supply of the lower limb
******************************************************************Arterial supply of the lower limb******************************************************************

Arterial supply of the lower limb starts at the [[Femoral artery]], which is the continuation of the external iliac artery, as it crosses the [[Inguinal ligament]].

The femoral artery then continues as the [[Popliteal artery]], which branches into the [[Anterior tibial artery]] and [[Posterior tibial artery]].
