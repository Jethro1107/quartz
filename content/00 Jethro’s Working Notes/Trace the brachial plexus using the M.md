### Trace the brachial plexus using the M

In dissection, the brachial plexus is quite difficult to identify in the axilla. Other than using the axillary artery, to identify the cords, use the M:

- **M**
    
    Laterally, the [[Musculocutaneous nerve]], in the middle, the lateral roots and medial roots of the [[Median nerve]] and medially, the [[Ulnar nerve]]. These structure tend to overlie the 3rd part of the [[Axillary artery]], which means it should be distal to the [[Pectoralis minor]]!
