# Somatosensation
Somatosensation is defined as sensation of different parts of the body, that detects for various modality of sensation, except for special senses.
### Modalities of somatosensation

### Somatosensation is mediated at 3 levels
#### Receptor levels
At the **receptor level**, somatosensation are mediated by various [[Somatosensory receptors]].

		- [[Two point discriminatory test demonstrates the effects of varying size of receptive fields and discriminatory touch]]
	- [[Smaller size of receptive fields and lateral inhibition facilitates spatial discrimination and localisation of stimuli]]
#### Circuit Level
Somatosensory signals are then transmitted by different **ascending pathways**, [[Somatosensory pathways are generally organised in a 3 neuron system]]:
- [[Dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway]]
- [[Spinothalamic pathway]]
- [[Spinocerebellar pathway]]
- In the head and neck - the [[Trigeminothalamic tract]]
#### Perceptual level
- Perception is generated at cortical sensory areas.
