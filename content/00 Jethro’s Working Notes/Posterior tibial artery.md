# Posterior tibial artery
The posterior tibial artery is a branch of the [[Popliteal artery]] as it crosses the inferior border of the popliteus.

### In the leg
The posterior tibial artery accompanies the [[Tibial nerve]] and courses deep to the flexor digitorum longus.
It gives off a branch, the peroneal artery, that descends within the posterior compartment of the leg, deep to the flexor haullicus longus.

### In the ankle and foot
The posterior tibial artery passes through the [[Tarsal tunnel]], and reflects onto the plantar surface of the foot, where it branches to give the medial plantar artery and the lateral plantar artery.
The lateral plantar artery gives rise to the plantar arch.
