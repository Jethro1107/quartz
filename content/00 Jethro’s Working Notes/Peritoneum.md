### Peritoneum

The peritoneum is a thin membrane (simple squamous mesothelium) that lines the inner surface of the abdominal wall ([[Anatomy of the Abdominal Wall]]) and the surface of the abdominal viscera.

- **There are two layers of the peritoneum:**
    
    Parietal peritoneum - Layer that lines the inner surface of the abdominal wall.
    
    Visceral peritoneum - Layer that lines the surface of abdominal viscera. 
    
    The space enclosed by the visceral and parietal peritoneum is the [[Peritoneal cavity]]  (a potential space).
