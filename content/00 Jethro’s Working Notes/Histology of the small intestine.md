### Histology of the small intestine
The small intestine consist of [[The common histological layers of the GI tract]], namely the mucosa, the submucosa, the muscularis externa and the serosa and adventitia.
- **Features of the mucosa of the small intestine**
    The mucosa is lined with a simple columnar epithelium that protrudes into the lumen to form [[Intestinal villi]], and invaginates deeply to form [[Crypts of Lieburkuhn (intestinal glands)]].

    The lamina propria may consist of lymphoid nodules (mostly in the ileum as [[Peyer’s Patch]] ).
    There is nothing distinct about the muscularis mucosae.
- **Features of the submucosa of the small intestine**
    The submucosa remains a dense irregular connective tissue with blood vessels and lymphatics.
    The submucosa protrudes towards the lumen to form [[Pilcae circulares]] , circular folds of the small intestine in gross anatomy.
    
    Note that in the proximal portion of the small intestine, the duodenum, submucosal glands are present as [[Brunner’s glands in the duodenum]] .
    
- **Features of the muscularis externa of the small intestine**
    The muscularis externa of the small intestine consist of 2 sublayers: the inner circular muscles and the outer longitudinal muscles.
    In between the two sublayers is the myenteric plexus.
- **Features of the serosa/adventita of the small intestine**
    The entire small intestine is lined with serosa, whereas retroperitoneal organs are lined with adventitia.

- Distinct features are present in different regions of the small intestine:
    - [[Brunner’s glands in the duodenum]]
    - [[Peyer’s Patch]] in the ileum
    - The jejunum appears as a textbook section of the small intestine.
