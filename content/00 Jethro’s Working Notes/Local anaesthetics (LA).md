# Local anaesthetics (LA)
Local anaesthetics is a class of drug that inhibits pain sensation.

### Classification and examples of local anaesthetics
LA can be classified by potency:
- Low potency - Procaine, Chloroprocaine
- Medium potency - Cocaine, Lignocaine (Lidocaine), Prilocaine, Mepivacaine
- High potency - Tetracaine, Bupivacaine, Etidocaine
LA can also be classified by chemical structure, into esters and amides:

### MOA of LA
Local anaesthetics diffuse across the plasma membrane and binds to voltage-gated Na+ channels intracellularly.
This raises the threshold for voltage-gated Na+ channels to open, i.e raises the threshold for action potential generation.
Hence, it prevents initiation, and subsequent propagation of action potentials in pain fibres, thus inhibiting pain sensation.
### Other than the potency of LA, there other [[Factors affecting Local anaesthetic effects of LA]].

### Adverse effects of LA
Systemic leak of LA (particularly with an increase in free drug fraction), can precipitate as LA toxicity: commonly with CNS and CVS disturbance.  
All excitable tissues are affected, and toxicity seems to be proportional to plasma drug levels and relative potency of the agent.

### Reversing LA toxicity
1. Stop LA
2. Advanced cardiac life support when there is CVS disturbance
3. Stop seizures - benzodiazepine
4. Correct acidosis or hypercapnia, as these factors tend to potentiate LA toxicity.
5. Intravenous lipid emulsion (lipid rescue
