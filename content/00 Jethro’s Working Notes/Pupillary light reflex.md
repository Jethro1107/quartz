### Pupillary light reflex
Pupillary light reflex is an autonomic reflex that detects for lights shone into the eyes, which results in bilateral pupil constriction.

### Reflex arc of pupillary light reflex
When light is shone in the eyes, the retinal ganglion cells are stimulated, which generates action potentials that travel via the optic nerve towards the pretectal nucleus unilaterally.

The pretectal nucleus then stimulates the accessory oculomotor nucleus bilaterally.

Action potentials then travel via the parasympathetic pathway via oculomotor nerve to the iris, stimulating pupil constriction bilaterally.

### Defects in different parts of pupillary light reflex yields different abnormal signs
A sensory defect in one eye results in impaired pupil constriction in both eye when it is stimulated.
A motor defect in one eye results in impaired pupil constriction in that eye when either eye is stimulated.
