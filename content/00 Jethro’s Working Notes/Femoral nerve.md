### Femoral nerve
The femoral nerve is formed by the union of the posterior division of the anterior rami of L2, L3, and L4. As it emerges lateral from the Psoas major and descends towards the inguinal ligament, it gives off branches to the [[Psoas major and iliacus]].

The femoral nerve accesses the thigh by crossing lateral to the mid-inguinal point, between the inguinal ligament and the hip bone ([[Gateways to the lower limb]]).
- ************************In the thigh************************
    Upon emerging from the inguinal ligament, it appears in the [[Femoral triangle]] of the thigh, where it lies laterally to the femoral artery.
    - The femoral nerve gives of motor branches that supply:
	    - Anterior compartment of the thigh - Quadriceps femoris and Sartorius ([[Muscles of the thigh]])
	    - Pectineus
	    - Iliacus

    - The femoral nerve also gives off sensory branches:
	    - The intermediate and medial cutaneous nerve of the thigh

	    - A long saphenous nerve, which passes through the [[Adductor canal]], and re-emerges at the knee, and courses cutaneously with the great saphenous vein ([[Superficial veins of the lower limb]]) to provide sensory innervation to the medial side of the leg and the foot, up to the ball of the big toe.

- Related pathologies - Femoral nerve injury:
	- Unstable knee joint, due to paralysis of quadriceps femoris. This results in difficulty in standing or walking.
	- Coping mechanism: Hand placed over the thigh to keep the knee extended.
