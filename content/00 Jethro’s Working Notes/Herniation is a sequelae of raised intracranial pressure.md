# Herniation is a sequelae of raised intracranial pressure
Herniation is defined as the displacement of brain parenchyma from one compartment ([[Dural folds are present with the cranial meninges#Dural folds separate cranium into compartments|Dural folds separate cranium into compartments]]) into another in response to [[Raised intracranial pressure]].
### Herniation is classified by the compartments involved or the structure that is pushed
There are 5 types of herniation:
1. [[Herniation is a sequelae of raised intracranial pressure#Transtentorial herniation|Transtentorial herniation]] (uncus herniation)
2. [[Herniation is a sequelae of raised intracranial pressure#Cerebellar tonsillar herniation|Cerebellar tonsillar herniation]]
3. Subfalcine herniation (supra callosal/ cinguate herniation)
4. Reversed tentorial herniation
5. Transcalvarial or fungus herniation
### Transtentorial herniation
Transtentorial herniation is often caused by a spaced occupying lesion in the medial aspects of the temporal lobe, where the uncus of the temporal lobe is compressed against the free maragins of the [[Dural folds are present with the cranial meninges#Tentorium cerebelli|Tentorium cerebelli]].
##### Sequelae of transtentorial herniation
1. The ipsilateral [[Occulomotor nerve (CN III)]] is compressed, resulting in efferent deficits of the [[Pupillary light reflex]], resulting in **fixed and dilated pupil** (or blown pupil).
2. The ipsilateral [[Brain circulation#^839396|Posterior cerebral artery]], resulting in ischemia and infarction of the occipital lobe (which houses the visual cortex), resulting in **cortical blindness**.
3. Herniation of the temporal lobe displaces the [[Midbrain]], compressing the contralateral cerebellar peduncle onto the free margins of the contralateral tentorium, which results in [[False localising sign]].
4. Compression of the midbrain and pons results in *loss of consciousness, change in respiration, decreased heart rate and increase in blood pressure*.
5. Obstruction of CSF flow ([[Cerebrospinal fluid pathway|CSF pathway]]), results in [[Hydrocephalus]].
6. Compression of optic nerve and retinal veins results in papilloedema.

### Cerebellar tonsillar herniation
Cerebellar tonsillar herniation is caused by a space occupying lesion that displaces the cerebellum through the foramen magnum.
##### Sequelae of tonsillar herniation
This compresses on the medulla, depression vital respiratory centres ([[CPR09-10 Control of Breathing I & II#Neural Control of Breathing]]) and cardiac centres, and is almost always fatal.
