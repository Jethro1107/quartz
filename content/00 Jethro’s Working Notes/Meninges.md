# Meninges
The **cranial meninges** is a 3-layered covering that lies immediately within the [[Cranium]]. It extends to cover the spinal cord as the [[Spinal meninges]].

### The meninges consists of 3 Layers
The **cranial meninges** consists of 3 layers. From outermost to innermost: 1) **Dura mater**, 2) **Arachnoid mater**, and 3) **Pia mater**.
##### Dura mater
The dura mater is the outermost layer of the **cranial meninges**, consisting of the outer [[Periosteum and endosteum#^86fa0b|Periosteal]] layer and the inner meningeal layer.
-  The **outer periosteal layer** closely adheres to the inner surface of the [[Cranium]], and is said to "terminate" at the **foramen magnum**... It essentially wraps and lines the external surface of the cranium. 
- The **inner menigeal layer** closely adheres to the underlying arachnoid mater, and continues through the foramen and becomes the meningeal dura of the [[Spinal meninges]].
[[Dural folds are present with the cranial meninges]]. ^7f341c

##### Arachnoid mater and the subarachnoid space
Arachnoid mater is the middle layer of of the meninges, consisting of trabeculae extending to the underlying **pia mater**.
- *The arachnoid mater overlies the subarachnoid space:*
	- It consists of [[Cerebrospinal fluid]] that is produced in the ventricles ([[Cerebrospinal fluid pathway]])
	- The subarachnoid space proviedes mechanical support to the cerebral vessels and [[Cranial nerves]].
	- It "cushions" the brain.

##### Pia mater
The pia mater is the innermost layer of the meninges.
The pia mater tightly adheres to the brain, following the gyruses and sulcuses of the brain and the spinal cord.
Together with cerebral arteries within the **subarachnoid space**, *the pia mater invaginates into the ventricles, forming [[Choroid plexus]] to produce CSF.*
