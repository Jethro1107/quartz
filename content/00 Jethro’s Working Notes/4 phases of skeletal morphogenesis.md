### 4 phases of skeletal morphogenesis

The 4 phases of skeletal morphogenesis involves:

1. Migration - Migration of mesenchymal cells towards epithelial cells
2. Cell interaction - Interaction of mesenchymal cells with basement membrane of epithelial cells
3. Condensation - Condensation of mesenchymal cells into a ball of cells
4. Differentiation - Differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteochondroprogenitors and the subsequent differentiation into chondrocytes ([[Chondrocyte differentiation requires activation of SOX9]]) and [[Osteoblast]] ([[Osteoblast differentiation requires activation of RUNX2]]).

Skeletal morphogenesis occurs in a proximo-distal sequencing, and begins with chondrocytes laying down [[Cartilage matrix]] to form a continuous cartilage rod, and through joint initiation forms forms cavitations, bifurcations and segmentations, resulting in formation of joint. *******************By the 6th week of development*******************, *a hyaline cartilage template of the appendicular skeleton is established.*

The hyaline cartilage then undergoes [[Endochondral ossification]] and is replaced by bone.
