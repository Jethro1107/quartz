# Thalamus
### General appearance of the thalamus
The two thalamus is described as two oval mass of gray matter that forms a major part of the diencephalon, forming the walls of the [[Ventricular system#3rd ventricle|3rd ventricle]].
The anterior end is narrow and round, the posterior end is expanded into the pulvinar, which overlies the superior colliculus of the [[Midbrain]].
The two thalamus are joined, at the anterior end by the **interthalamic adhesion**.
### Internal organization of the thalamus
The thalamus is first divided by the Y-shaped **laminar** into the *anterior part, medial part and the posterior part.* Each part houses specific thalamic nuclei.
##### Anterior part
- The **anterior nucleus** is located within the anterior part. It receives sensory signals from the mamillary body of the fornix, where the axons from the anterior nucleus projects to the **cingulate gyrus**.
##### Medial part
- The **mediodorsal nucleus** is located within the medial part, and receives sensory signals from the [[Substantia niagra]], ventral pallidum, olfactory cortex and amygdala, and projects to the **prefrontal cortex**.
##### Lateral part
- The lateral part is further subdivided into the ventral part and the dorsal part.
###### Ventral Part
- Ventral part is subdivided into the ventral anterior nucleus, ventral lateral nucleus and ventral posterior nucleus. *The pulvinar is also comprises the ventral division of the lateral part of the thalamus, and houses the lateral geniculate body and the medial geniculate body*.
- The ventral anterior nucleus receives signals from the  **globus pallidus** of the [[Basal ganglia]], which projects to the **premotor cortex**.
- The ventral lateral nucleus receives sensory signals fromthe [[Cerebellum]], and projects to the [[Motor cortex]].
- The **ventral posterior nucleus** is further subdivided into two nucleus: the vetral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus and the ventral posteromedial (VPM) nucleus, which receives somatosensory signals of the trunk and limbs from [[Dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway|Medial lamniscus]], [[Spinothalamic pathway|Spinothalamic tract]] and somatosensory signals of the head and neck from the trigeminal lamniscus respectively. Both project to the primary somatosensory cortex for [[Somatosensation]]. ^006c17
- The **lateral geniculate nucleus** receives special sensory signals from the [[Optic nerve (CN II)#Optic tract|Optic tract]], and projects to the visual cortex.
- The **medial geniculate nucleus** receives ascending signals from the inferior colliculus of the [[Midbrain]], via the **inferior branchium**, and projects to the auditory cortex.

### Functions of the thalamus
The thalamus serves as a relay centre for all sensory imputs to the corresponding areas of the cortex.
