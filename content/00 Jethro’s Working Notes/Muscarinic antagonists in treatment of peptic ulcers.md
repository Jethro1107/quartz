# Muscarinic antagonists in treatment of peptic ulcers
### Examples of muscarinic antagonists
Pirenzepine, Dicyclopine

### MOA of muscarinic antagonists in treatment of peptic ulcers
Muscarinic antagonists binds to and inhibits M3 receptors in parietal cells. This results in reduced intracellular Ca2+ levels, and prevents the activation fo H+/K+ ATPase.

This reduces gastric acid secretion.

However, muscarinic antagonists are not as effective as [[H2 antagonists in the treatment of peptic ulcers]], and [[Proton pump inhibitors]], only reducing gastric acid secretion by 20-30%, and thus are *rarely used now*.
### Adverse effects of muscarinic antagonists
As muscarinic antagonists are present on many organs, they result in many side effects:
- Dry mouth
- Blurred vision
- Cardiac arrhythmias
- Urinary retention
