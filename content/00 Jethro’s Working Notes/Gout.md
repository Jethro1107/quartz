### What is gout?
Gout is a form of crystal arthritis, inflammatory joint disorder ([[Pathology of the joint]]), marked by transient attacks of ***************acute arthritis*************** initiated by urate crystals deposited within or around the joint.
Gout can be classified into primary gout, where the exact cause is not known, or secondary gout, which is secondary to some other diseases.
### Pathogenesis of gout
In most cases, gout is precipitated by *************hyperuricemia************* (>6.8 mg/dL), due to abnormal [[Uric acid metabolism]], with increase in uric acid synthesis or decrease in uric acid excretion ([[Causes of primary and secondary hyperuricemia]]). *However, in 30% of the cases, serum uric acid levels are within normal limits.*
**In primary gout - Hyperuricemia is often caused by a reduced uric acid excretion with no known cause.**
In secondary gout - Hyperuricemia can be caused by increased synthesis (in HGPRT deficiency, Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome, Tumour lysis syndrome), or by decreased excretion (in chronic kidney disease, refer to [[Chronic kidney disease (CKD)]]).

Hyperuricemia results in precipitation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals within or around the joint, which triggers inflammation.

Inflammation in gout is triggered via 3 pathways:
1. **Inflammasome pathway** Macrophages phagocytose urate crystals, which trigger a cytosolic sensor, **********inflammasome**********, which activates an enzyme, caspase-1 that cleaves the precursor if IL-1 into active form of IL-1. IL-1 a pro-inflammatory, and recruits neutrophils and macrophages into the joint.
2. **Complement pathway**. Urate crystals results in complement activation via the alternative pathway, resulting in neutrophil chemotaxis.
3. **Cellular trauma**. When neutrophils and macrophages phagocytose large urate crystals, they pierce through the membrane, resulting in the release of lysosomal enzymes.

Inflammatory cells release cytokines, ROS, protease and arachidonic acid metabolites, resulting in tissue injury and inflammation, which presents as acute gouty arthritis.

Repeated gouty attacks eventually results in a granulomatous response that results in tophi formation, aggregates of urate crystals surrounded by macrophages, and giant cells.

### Pathology of gout
In the initial attacks, gout ressembles other forms of acute inflammatory arthritis.

As gout develops into chronic tophaceous arthritis, it is characterised with:
- Large chalky white deposits in the synovium.

### Histopathology of gout
Acute gouty arthritis is characterised with:
- Eosinophilic material (urate crystal deposits) on the synovium, surrounded by inflammatory infiltrates
- Inflammation and oedema of the synovium

Chronic tophaceous arthritis is characterised with:
- Gouty tophi formation, a [[foreign body granuloma]], with eosinophilic mterial surrounded by the macrophages and foreign body giant cells.
- Gouty tophi that erodes into articular cartilage and periarticular bone.

### Clinical features/ Natural history of gout
There are 4 identifiable stages of gout: 1) **Asymptomatic hyperuricemia**, 2) **Acute gouty arthrtis**, 3) **Intercritical gout**, 4) **Chronic tophaceous gout**.

Prolonged asymptomatic hyperuricemia (almost for 20-30 years) will eventually precipitate as:

**Acute gouty arthritis** - It presents with sudden onset of excruciating joint pain, localised erythema and warmth. 
- Systemic effects, pruritis and desquamated skin is also common.
- The first attacks are usually monoarticular, which involve the ****metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe (20%)****, wheras subsequent attacks may become polyarticular.

**Intercritical gout** - Resolution is achieved and the individual enters an **********************assymptomatic interval.********************** This is a quite distinct feature of gout, when compared with other inflammatory joint disorders.

Repeated gouty attacks eventually results in the development of **chronic tophaceous gout**.
- It is characterised with chronic joint pain, with occasional exacerbations.
- Errosion of periarticular bone results in loss of joint function.
- Gouti tophi formation in the joint synovium, olecranon bursa and ear lobes (usually not painful).

- **********************************Investigations/ Diagnosis of gout**********************************
    Blood tests:
    - Neutrophilic leukocytosis, elevated ESR, CRP is common in gouty flares.
    - Serum uric acid levels is useful, but not diagnostic.
    
    Definitive diagnosis requires:
    - Demonstration of crystals on joint aspiration. Urate crystals are long, slender, needle-shaped and negatively birefringent on **polarised microscopy**.
