# Gastric factors promote gastric emptying
Gastric factors (both nervous and hormonal) are known to initiate, and subsequently promote [[Gastric emptying]].

- **************************************************************************************************************************************************Neural and hormonal gastric factors regulate gastric emptying**************************************************************************************************************************************************
    1. *******************************Extent of stomach filling, or gastric volume determines gastric emptying.*******************************
        Increase in gastric volume, results in distension of the stomach, which triggers a local myenteric reflex in the [[Enteric nervous system]], that accentuates the activity of the pyloric pump and relaxes the pyloric sphincter, thus promoting gastric emptying.
        
    2. *Gastrin has mild to moderate activity to stimulate gastric emptying.*
        Distension of the stomach as well as presence of partially digested protein stimulates G cells in the pylorus to release gastrin.
        Gastrin enters circulation and returns to the stomach, and mildly stimulates the pyloric pump, thus promoting gastric emptying.
