### About these notes

Hi, I’m Jethro. You’ve now stumbled upon my working notes ([[]]). Inspired by [[Andy Matuschak]] ‘s theory on knowledge work (particularly on [[Working with the garage door open]]), I have decided to open the gates to my thinking environment.

I assume most of you who access my notes are in hopes of reading my notes for MBBS. I will tag all MBBS notes with `Medicine` and according to the corresponding blocks. My notes are concept-oriented, rather than lecture oriented(classified into anatomy concepts, physiology concepts, disease syndromes, clinical skills, ethics etc.) Hopefully this will be different perspective of understanding our preclinical syllabus. Below are the medicine related notes I’m working on:

- Medicine:
    - `MSS` Block hit me like a truck:
        - Almost done with notes on the [[Anatomy of the upper limb]], was able to identify structures in the arm and forearm during dissection, not so much in the [[Axilla]].
        - Hopefully can finish notes on [[Anatomy of the lower limb]]
        - MSS dissection is difficult, as [[Regional anatomy of the limb misses the point, learning anatomy of the limbs by structure reveals its clinical significance]].
    - GIS block is here! Notes taken revolving around the block will be tagged with `GIS`
        - [[Anatomy of the Abdomen]] | [[Anatomy of the Abdominal Wall]]
        - [[Histology of the GI tract]]
        - Gastrointestinal physiology (tagged: `GIS` and `Physiology` | [[Gastric secretions]] | [[Digestive and absorption]] | [[Pancreatic secretions]] | [[Biliary secretion]] | [[Fluid movement in the intestine]] |
    - Improving my understanding of [[Respiratory anatomy]], the need for such refinement is demonstrated in the summative assessment
    - Learning about [[Respiratory Examination]], preparing for OSCE examination
    - Learning about [[Cardiovascular Examination]], preparing for OSCE examination
    - [[Blood Pressure Measurement]]

> A big disclaimer, I am a bad student. There may be some misinformation in my medicine-related notes. Please contact me if there are any notes that require changing.
