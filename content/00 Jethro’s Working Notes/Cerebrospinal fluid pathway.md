# Cerebrospinal fluid pathway
There are 3 steps to the CSF pathway: 1) **Production**, 2) **Circulation**, and 3) **Reabsorption**.
### Production of CSF
[[Cerebrospinal fluid]] is produced by the [[Choroid plexus]] in the 4 ventricles ([[Ventricular system]]).
Daily production of CSF is roughly 450ml/day.

### Circulation of CSF
CSF in the lateral ventricles drains through the **interventricular foramina of Monro** into the 3rd ventricle, which drains through the **cerebral aqueduct** into the 4th ventricle, which then drains into the spinal canal.
Within the 4th ventricle, CSF drains through the 2 lateral apertures and the medial apertures into the [[Meninges#Arachnoid mater and the subarachnoid space|Subarachnoid space]].

### Reabsorption of CSF
In [[Dural folds are present with the cranial meninges|Dural folds]], arachnoid granulation project into the [[Dural venous sinus]], resulting in reabsorption of CSF in subarachnoid space into blood.

Any defects along the CSF pathway will result in [[Hydrocephalus]].
