### Seddon and Sunderland classification of nerve injury classifies nerve injuries into:
- **Neuropraxia** - Where the axon remains intact, with focal segmental demyelination only.
- **Axonotmesis** - Where there is axonal discontinuities, with varying degrees of endoneurial and perineurial discontinuities.
- **Neurotmesis** - Where there is complete nerve transection, with discontinuities in the myelin shealth, axon, endoneurium, perineurium and exoneurium.

- The class of nerve injury directly implicates time for recovery, and even the complexity of recovery.
    Neurapraxia takes days to weeks, axonotmesis takes monthes, and neurotmesis takes years, or may never recovery.
