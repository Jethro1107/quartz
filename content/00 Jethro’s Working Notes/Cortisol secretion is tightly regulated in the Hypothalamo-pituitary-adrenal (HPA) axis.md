# Cortisol secretion is tightly regulated in the Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
The hypothalamus releases corticotrophin releasing factors, which stimulate the release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ATCH) released by the anterior pituitary.

Once stimulated by adrenocorticotrophic hormone, the adrenal cortex increases synthesis of steroid hormones, particularly glucocorticoids/cortisol. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone also triggers release of cortisol.

Cortisol negatively feedbacks to the hypothalamus, inhibiting the release of CRF, which inhibits release of ATCH by anterior pituitary.
