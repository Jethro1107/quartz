# Radial artery
The radial artery is a branch of the [[Brachial artery]].

- **In the arm**
    The radial artery descends deep to the brachioradialis, which accompanies the superficial branch of the [[Radial nerve]]. At the distal forearm, it lies lateral to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis.
- **In the wrist and hand**
    In the wrist, it gives rise to the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery which anastamose with the [[superficial palmar arch of the ulnar artery]], where the radial artery continues and crosses beneath the tendons of the abductor pollicus longus and extensor pollicus brevis, and reappears in the [[Anatomical snuffbox]].

    The radial artery then continues as the deep palmar arch.
