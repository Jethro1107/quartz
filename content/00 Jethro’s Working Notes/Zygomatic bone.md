# Zygomatic bone
The zygomatic bone is a paired bone that forms part of the [[Viscerocranium]].
It is also *refered to as the cheekbone*.
### Parts of the zygomatic bone
The zygomatic bone has the body, the frontal process, the maxillary process, and the temporal process.
##### Frontal process
The frontal process projects superiorly to articulate with the [[frontal bone]].
It forms the lateral borders of the orbit.
##### Maxillary process
The maxillary process projects medially and articulates the [[Maxilla#Zygomatic process|Zygomatic process of the maxilla]].
##### Temporal process
The temporal process projects posteriorly and articulates with the zygomatic process of the [[Temporal bone]], collectively forming the zygomatic arch.
