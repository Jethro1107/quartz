### Definition of a reflex
Reflex is defined as a *rapid, automatic and predictable (stereotypical) response to a stimuli*, mediated by a **reflex arc**.

### Composition of a reflex arc
A reflex arc consist of a receptor, a sensory neuron, an integration centre, a motor neuron and an effector.

Receptor - detects the stimuli

Sensory neuron - transmits impulse from the receptor to the CNS (integration centre)

Integration centre - part of the CNS which interprets the sensory information and coordinates a response to the stimuli

Motor neuron - transmits impulse from CNS (integration centre) to effector

Effector - muscle or gland (depending on the type of reflex) that produces a response under the influence of the motor neuron

### Classification and examples of reflex
- By number of synapse involved: Monosynaptic reflex and polysynaptic reflex
- By development: Inborn reflex vs Acquired reflex
- By CNS component involved: Cranial reflex vs Spinal reflex
- By effector: Somatic reflex vs autonomic reflex
	- Examples of somatic reflex: [[Stretch reflex]], [[Golgi tendon reflex]]
	- Examples of autonomic reflex: Baroreceptor reflex, Chemoreceptor reflex, Defaecation reflex, Micturition reflex, [[Pupillary light reflex]]
