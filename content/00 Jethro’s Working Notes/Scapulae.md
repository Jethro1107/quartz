# Scapulae

The scapulae is classified as a flat bone. It is a large triangular bone that overlies the ribs, with:
- 3 angles - The superior angle, the inferior angle and the lateral angle, which expands to form the glenoid fossa.
- 3 borders - The superior border, the medial border and the lateral border.
- 3 processes - The spine, the acromion and the corocoid process.
- 2 surfaces - The posterior surface, and the anterior surface, known as the scapular/ suprascapular fossa.
#### Glenoid fossa
The lateral angle of the scapulae forms the glenoid fossa, a pear shaped depression which serves as the socket for the [[Shoulder joint (Glenohumeral joint)]].

The supraglenoid tubercle and infraglenoid tubercle is present. The supraglenoid serves as the attachment for the long head of the [[Biceps brachii]] muscle. Infraglenoid tubercle serves as the attachment for the long head of the [[Triceps brachii]] muscle.

#### The spine and acromion
The spine is a process on the posterior surface which travels laterally and becomes enlarged to form the acromion (the tip of the shoulder).

#### Posterior surface
The posterior surface is separated into the supraspinous fossa and the infraspinous fossa.
#### Two structures are present on the superior border
The lateral end of the superior border forms the coracoid process, a structure that resembles the beak of the raven. It serves as a surface for the attachment of ligaments and muscles.

Just medial to the coracoid process, the suprascapular notch is present. A ligament, the superior transverse scapular ligament closes off the notch, converting the suprascapular notch into the suprascapular foramen, which is for the passage of the [[Suprascapular nerve]].

#### The anterior surface of the scapulae
The anterior surface of the scapulae forms the subscapular fossa. It is concave to accomodate for the roundness of the thoracic cage.
