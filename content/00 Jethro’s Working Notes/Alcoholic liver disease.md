### Alcoholic liver disease

- **What is alcoholic liver disease?**
    Alcoholic liver disease, or alcoholic fatty liver disease refers to fatty liver disease that is caused by excessive consumption of alcohol.
- **Clinical manifestations of alcoholic liver disease**
    Alcoholic liver disease can trigger a spectrum of hepatic changes, ranging from:
    - Hepatocellular steatosis (fatty liver)
    - Alcoholic hepatitis
    - Liver fibrosis and [[Cirrhosis]]
    Steatosis and alcoholic hepatitis are reversible, whereas liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are irreversible.
    These hepatic changes may develop independently, or as a continuum.
