# Temporal bone
The temporal bone is a paired bone that forms part of the cranial base of the [[Neurocranium]].
### Parts of the temporal bone
The temporal bone has a **squamous part**, and a **petrous part**, **mastoid part**, and **typanic part**.
##### Squamous part
The squamous part forms the anterior and superior part of the temporal bone, which articulates with the greater wing of the [[Sphenoid bone]] anteriorly, and the parietal bone posteriorly.
##### Mastoid part
The mastoid part extends posterolaterally from the [[#Squamous part|Squamous part]] of the temporal bone.
##### Petrous part
The petrous part extends medially from the squamous part.
##### Tympanic part
The typanic part is the extends inferiorly from the squamous part, below the level of the zygomatic process.

### Features of the temporal bone
##### Processes
- The **zygomatic process** of the temporal bone is a bony projection from the *lower border of the squamous part*. It meets the temporal process of the [[Zygomatic bone]], to *form the zygomatic arch*.
- The **mastoid process** is a bony projection from the *inferior border of the mastoid part*, for the attachment of muscles.
- The **styloid process** is a bony projection that lies medial to the mastoid process, for the attachment of sytlohyloid muscles.
##### The external meatus opening
The external meatus opening can be seen in the [[#Tympanic part]] of the temporal bone, and opens to the "auditory" canal.
##### Other features can be viewed on the inferior view of the [[Neurocranium#Cranial base|Cranial base of the neurocranium]]
- Laterally, the digastric notch serves as the attachment of the digastric muscles.
- The stylomastoid foramen, between the styloid process and the mastoid process, serves as the exit of the fascial nerve.
- Further proceeding laterally, is the anterior carotid foramen and the posterior jugular foramen, for the entry of the internal carotid artery and exit of internal jugular vein respectively.
- Anteriorly, the mandibular (glenoid) fossa can be seen, which serves as the articular facet for the temporomandibular joint.
- The foramen lacerum is found most medially on the petrous part of the temporal bone, and is the exit for the great petrosal nerve (branch of the fascial nerve).
