- ### [[Anatomy of the Abdominal Wall]]

Much of the GI tract and its accessory organs are located in the abdominal cavity, much of which is located in the peritoneal cavity.

- The [[Peritoneum]] encloses the [[Peritoneal cavity]].

Within the [[Peritoneal cavity]], consist of [[Mesenteries (Peritoneal [[folds)]]]] which connect adominal viscera to each other and the abdominal wall. Anatomically significant mesenteries include the [[Greater omentum]] and the [[Lesser omentum]].
