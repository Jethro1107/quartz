# Somatosensory pathways are generally organised in a 3 neuron system
A 3 neuron system propagates somatosensory signals from somatosensory receptors (mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, and nociceptors) to the somatosensory cortex, consisting of **1st order neurons**, **2nd order neurons** and **3rd order neurons**.

### 1st order neurons
1st order neurons are located within the [[Peripheral nervous system]], with *cell bodies within the dorsal root ganglia*.
They transmit somatosensory signals from the somatosensory receptors to 2nd order neurons within the [[Central nervous system]].
### 2nd order neurons
2nd order neurons transmit signals from 1st order neurons to 3rd order neurons within the thalamus, or the cerebellum.
Axons *decussate to the contralateral side*, such that sensory signals are processed by the contralateral side of the brain.
### 3rd order neurons
3rd order neurons are found in the [[Thalamus]], and project to the somatosensory cortex.
