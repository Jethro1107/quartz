# Midbrain
The midbrain (or **mesencephalon**) is the superior structure of the [[Brainstem]].

### Surface anatomy of the midbrain
- **Anterior features**
	- Anteriorly, the midbrain is characterised by **cerebral peduncles** and the **interpeduncular fossa**, from which the **[[Occulomotor nerve (CN III)]] emerges from**.
- **Posterior features of the midbrain**
	- Posteriorly, the midbrain is characterised by the **superior colliculus** and the **inferior colliculus**.
		- The superior colliculus has vision and motor functions, while the inferior colliculus has hearing and motor functions.
	- The [[Trochlear nerve (CN IV)|Trochlear nerve]] emerges inferior to the inferior colliculus, and is the only nerve that emerges posteriorly of the brainstem.

### Internal structures of the midbrain
##### Descending pathways
- Ventrally, within the **cerebral peduncle**, corticospinal tract, corticobulbar tract and corticopontine tract is present.
##### Ascending pathways
- Dorsolaterally, the medial meniscus of the [[Dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway]] ascends in an oblique plane.
##### Cranial nerve nuclei
- The main occulomotor nucleus ([[Occulomotor nerve (CN III)]]) is located anterior to the periaqueductal gray medially, at the *level of the superior colliculus*.
- The trochlear nucleus ([[Trochlear nerve (CN IV)]]) is located anterior to the periaqueductal gray medially, inferior to the main occulomotor nucleus, at the *level of the inferior colliculus*.

##### Other features of the midbrain
**Substantial niagra**, part of the [[Basal ganglia]], located ventrally just dorsal to the cerebral peducle houses dopaminergic neurons, with axons protruding to the striatum of the basal ganglia.
**Red nucleus**, located medially, associated with motor functions.
**Cerebral aqueduct**, located dorsally, and surrounded by the **periaqueductal gray**, *drains cerebrospinal fluid from the 3rd ventricle to the 4th ventricle* ([[Cerebrospinal fluid pathway]]).
