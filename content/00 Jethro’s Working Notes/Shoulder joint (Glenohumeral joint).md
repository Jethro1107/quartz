### Shoulder joint (Glenohumeral joint)
The shoulder joint (or glenohumeral joint) is the joint between the glenoid fossa of the [[Scapulae]] and the head of the [[Humerus]].

The surface area of the humerus is 4 times that of the glenoid fossa, which renders the joint very unstable due to poor congruency between the articular sites. However, this enables a great range of movement.

The margins of the glenoid fossa is lined by a fibrocartilage, glenoid labrum, which deepens the glenoid fossa it improve congruency and hence the stability.

#### Classification of the glenohumeral joint
The glenohumeral joint is classified as a synovial ball and socket joint, which enables a large range of movement.

#### Joint capsule of the glenohumeral joint
The joint capsule of the glenohumeral joint is loose fitting.

Its proximal attachment is just outside the glenoid labrum, whereas its distal attachment is at the anatomical neck, except for the inferior part, which attaches to the surgical neck.
- **The joint capsule is thickened:**
	Superiorly and anteriorly, it forms the glenohumeral ligament.
	Superiorly, it forms the coracohumeral ligament.
	Between the greater and lesser tubercles of the humerus, it forms the transverse humeral ligament.

- **Bursa of the shoulder joint**
	- The subscapularis bursa is located anteriorly, just beneath the tendon of the subscapularis, which lubricates the tendon of the subscapularis. The subscapularis bursa is continuous with the synovial cavity.
	- The subdeltoid bursa and subacromial bursa is located superiorly, beneath the acromion and the deltoid muscle. They usually do not communicate with the synovial cavity.
	- The intertubercular synovial sheath surrounds the long head of the biceps brachii, and is continuous with the synovial cavity.

#### Stabilization of the shoulder joint
Stability is provided by external ligaments and associated muscle tendons.

The corocoacromial ligament (extrinsic ligament) forms a secondary socket to prevent upward dislocation of the joint.

The rotary cuff muscles (Supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres major and subscapularis) holds the head of the humerus into the glenoid fossa.

#### Movement of the shoulder joint
The shoulder joint has a great range of movement, enabling:
- Flexion and extension
- Abduction (away from the trunk) and adduction (towards the trunk) - Note that full abduction involves both the movement at the shoulder joint and the rotation of the scapulae, i.e [[Full abduction involves upward rotation of the scapulae]].
- Medial rotation and lateral rotation
- Circumduction
