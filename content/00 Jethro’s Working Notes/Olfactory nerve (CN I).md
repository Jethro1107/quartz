# Olfactory nerve (CN I)
Olfactory nerves (CN I) are nerves arising from the bipolar cells in the [[Functional histology of the Respiratory System#^28f622|Olfactory epithelium]], responsible for olfaction.
### Function and Functional component of olfactory nerve (CN I)
Olfactory nerve is responsible for olfaction.
It consists of special sensory component.
### Pathway of olfactory nerve
Axons of bipolar cells in the olfactory epithelium course through the olfactory nerve, where it pierces through the Cribiform plate of the [[Ethmoid bone]], and synapses with the the secondary olfactory neurons (**Mitral cells and Tufted cells**) within the **olfactory bulb**.
Axons of the secondary olfactory neurons *course within the olfactory tract*, a narrow band of white matter running beneath the inferior surface of the frontal lobe.
Axons of secondary olfactory neurons may pass into the **lateral stria**, and projected to the ipsilateral primary olfactory (piriform) cortex of the **temporal lobe**.
Axons of secondary olfactory neurons may pass into the medial stria, and passes through the **anterior commisure**, which projects to the contralateral olfactory structures.

### Defects of olfactory nerve
Defects of the olfactory nerve will result in **anosmia**, *a loss of sense of smell*.
