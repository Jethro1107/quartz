# Popliteal artery
The popliteal artery is the continuation of the [[Femoral artery]] as it leaves the [[Adductor canal]] from the adductor hiatus and accesses the [[Popliteal fossa]].

### In the Popliteal Fossa
It is the deepest structure of the popliteal fossa, deep to the [[Tibial nerve]] and the popliteal vein.
It contributes to the [[Genicular anastamosis]].
### Distal to the Popliteal fossa
The popliteal artery crosses the lower border of the popliteus, through the tendinous arch of the soleus it divides into the [[Anterior tibial artery]], and [[Posterior tibial artery]].
