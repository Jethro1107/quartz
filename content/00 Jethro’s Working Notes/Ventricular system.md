# Ventricular system
The ventricular system is a *continuous system of 4 cavities within the brain*, derived from the central canal of the [[IAS41 Implantation and Trilaminar Embryo#^c44f3a|Neural tube]] during embryological development.
The 4 ventricles are the 2 **lateral ventricles**, the **3rd ventricle**, and the **4th ventricle**.
### Common components of the 4 ventricles
All 4 ventricles consist of [[Choroid plexus]] for the production of [[Cerebrospinal fluid]]. which circulate within the [[Cerebrospinal fluid pathway]].
The choroid plexus is lined with **ependyma**, [[IAS38 Neural Architecture#^osot71| made of ependymal cells]].

### Lateral ventricles
The two lateral ventricles are *C-shaped cavities found within the cerebral hemispheres*.
The body is found within the **parietal lobe**, with a **frontal horn** that extends into the frontal lobe, a **temporal horn** that extends into the temporal lobe, and an **occipital horn** that extends into the occipital lobe (Cf: [[Lobes of the cerebral hemisphere]]).

### 3rd ventricle
The 3rd ventricle is a *cleft-shaped cavity found between the two [[Thalamus]]*, i.e. the thalamus (or even the diencephalon) forms the walls of the 3rd ventricle.
The two thalamus are connected by the **interthalamic adhesion**, which *subsequently is surrounded by the 3rd ventricle*.
It communicates anteriorly with the lateral ventricles via the **interventricular foramina of Monro** and posteriorly with the 4th ventricle via the **cerebral aqueduct**.

### 4th ventricle
The 4th ventricle lies between the lower [[Brainstem]], i.e. the [[Medulla]] and lower [[Pons]] and the [[Cerebellum]].
It consists of 2 lateral aperture, and 1 median aperture, that drains [[Cerebrospinal fluid]] into the [[Meninges#Arachnoid mater and the subarachnoid space|Subarachnoid space]].
It is also continuous with the central canal of the spinal cord.
