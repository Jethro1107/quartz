# Central cord syndrome
Central cord syndrome is the most common incomplete [[Spinal cord injury]] that is almost always caused by traumatic injury.

### Etiology/Pathoanatomy of central cord syndrome
Central cord syndrome is almost always caused by:

- Traumatic injury, particularly hyperextension injury of the neck, that results in cervical spinal stenosis

Other etiologies are less common:
- [[Cervical myelopathy]]
- Syringomyelia
- Neoplasms - Either metastatic, glial neoplasia, or lymphoma
### Pathophysiology of central cord syndrome
Central cord syndrome results in compression of the central region of the spinal cord, resulting in sensory and motor deficits:
Sensory deficits:
- Compression on the lateral spinothalamic tract is more severe than the dorsal column, hence loss in pain and temperature sensation is more severe than posterior column sensations (deep touch, proprioception, vibration sensation).

Motor deficits:
- As the axons for cervical regions is located more centrally than those for lumbosacral region in the lateral corticospinal tract, muscle weakness in the upper limb is more severe than that in the lower limb.
