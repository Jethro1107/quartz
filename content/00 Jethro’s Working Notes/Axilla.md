### Axilla

The axilla is a body region that serves as a transition between the neck and the arm. It is defined as an irregular 4-sided pyramid, with 4 walls, and axillary inlet and the floor.

- ****************************Axillary inlet****************************
    
    The axillary inlet is roughly a triangular structure with the apex on the lateral side, formed by the coracoid process of the scapulae:
    
    - Its base is formed by the lateral border of the 1st rib
    - Its anterior margin is formed by the posterior border of the clavicle
    - Its posterior margin is formed by the superior border of the scapulae up to the coracoid process

- **********************Anterior axillary wall**********************
    
    The anterior axillary wall is formed by 3 muscles: the superficial [[Pectoralis major]], and the deep [[Pectoralis minor]] and [[Subclavius]].

- ****************************************Medial axillary wall****************************************
    
    The medial axillary wall is formed by the upper thoracic wall and associated intercostal tissue, and the overlying [[Serratus anterior]]. Note the presence of the [[Long thoracic nerve]], which descends along the medial axillary wall to supply the serratus anterior muscle.

- ************************Lateral axillary wall************************
    
    The lateral axillary wall is formed only by the intertubercular groove of the [[Humerus]]. It provides the surface for the attachment of the muscles of the anterior axillary wall ([[Pectoralis major]]) and the posterior axillary wall ([[Latissimus dorsi]], [[Teres major]]).
    
- **********************Posterior axillary wall**********************
    
    The posterior axillary wall is formed by 4 muscles:
    
    - Subscapularis
    - Distal parts of the [[Latissimus dorsi]] and the [[Teres major]]
    - Long head of the [[Triceps brachii]]

- ********************************Floor (base) of the axilla********************************
    
    The floor of the axilla is formed by fascia and a dome of the skin. It forms the armpit.
    
    The fascia is supported by the clavicopectoral fascia.
    
- ********************************************Contents of the axilla********************************************
    
    The axilla is a relatively large space that consist of many structures:
    
    - Muscles - Proximal ends of the [[Biceps brachii]] and [[Coracobrachialis]]
    - [[Axillary artery]] - The subclavian artery crosses the lateral border of the rib I, and enters the axilla via the axillary inlet. It is renamed into the axillary artery.
        
        The axillary artery consist of 3 parts:
        
        1. 1st part of the axillary artery is proximal to the [[Pectoralis minor]]
        2. 2nd part of the axillary artery is ***********posterior*********** to the pectoralis minor
        3. 3rd part of the axillary artery is distal to the pectoralis minor.
    - Axillary vein - The vein which courses medially and anteriorly to the axillary artery.
    - The trunks of the [[Brachial plexus]] and associated branches, which is largely associated with the walls of the axilla.
    - Lymphatics
    - Fatsâ€¦ lots and lots of fat
