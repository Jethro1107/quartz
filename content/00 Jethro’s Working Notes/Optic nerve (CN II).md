# Optic nerve (CN II)
Optic nerve consist of *axons arising from the ganglionic layer of the retina*, which pass through the optic canal. The two optic nerves converge to form the optic chiasm, and divide into the two optic tracts.
### Optic chiasm
The two optic nerves converge to form the optic chiasm, situated anterior to the [[Midbrain]].
### Optic tract
The two optic tract emerges from the optic chiasm, and passes posterolaterally around the cerebral peduncle of the [[Midbrain]].
Most fibres in optic tract synapse at the lateral geniculate body of the [[Thalamus]], mediating the [[#Visual pathway of optic nerve]], while some pass to the **prectectal nucleus and superior colliculus** of the midbrain to mediate the [[Pupillary light reflex]].
### Functional component of Optic nerve
It consist of special sensory component.
### Function of optic nerve
It is involved in vision.
It is also involved as the *afferent pathway of the [[Pupillary light reflex]]*.
### Visual pathway of optic nerve
Upon stimulation of **photoreceptors** (cones and rods), they stimulate bipolar neurons, which stimulate the retinal ganglion cells.
Axons of retinal ganglion cells pass through the optic nerve towards the optic chiasm.
- Axons of medial gangion cells *cross the optic chiasm and passes through the cotralateral optic tract*, and synapse with secondary sensory neurons in the contralateral **lateral geniculate nucleus of the [[Thalamus]]**.
- Axons of lateral ganglion cells *pass the ipsilateral optic tract*, and synapse at the ipsilateral **lateral genicular nucleus of the thalamus**.
Axons from neurons from the lateral genicular nucleus pass to the visual cortex.
