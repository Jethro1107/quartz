### What is rheumatoid arthritis?
Rheumatoid arthritis is a common, chronic, symmetrical polyarticular arthritis. It is the commonest autoimmune arthritis.

### Clinical course of rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis initially starts with onset of systemic effects: fever, malaise and generalised musculoskeletal pain, before the onset of joint symptoms and extra-articular manifestations.
Joint symptoms are characterised joint pain that involves:
- The carpomatecarpal joints (CMC joints), proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP joints) of the fingers
- Wrist joint, elbow joint and Knee joint are also commonly involved.

- Joints involvement is chronic, symmetrical and polyarticular.
- There is often morning stiffness of the joints.
- On physical examination, the joints show soft tissue swelling, with warmth and erythema (showing the cardinal signs of inflammation).
Joint symptoms take a wax and wane course.

In severe RA, there may be adjacent soft tissue involvement (ligaments and tendons), which result in radial deviation of the wrist, ulnar deviation of the digits, and swan-neck and boutonniere deformities of the digits.

### Investigations for rheumatoid arthritis
Blood tests:
- There is leukocytosis on CBC, with positive ESR or CRP, indicating inflammation.
- Most rheumatoid arthritis patients are positive for ACPA (anti-citrullinated protein antibodies) or rheumatoid factors.

Radiological features are predictable:
- Soft tissue swelling and joint space widening initially
	This is due to synovial inflammation and joint effusion.

- Juxta-articular osteoporosis
	This is due to hyperaemia from synovial inflammation, and disuse of the joint.

- Severe RA shows joint space narrowing
	As pannus erodes through the articular cartilage.

- Periarticular erosions
	Osteoclastic activity in pannus erodes through bone within the joint capsule.

### Diagnostic criteria of rheumatoid arthritis
A score of more than 6 in the ACR-EULAR criteria is sufficient for diagnosis of RA. Scores are given in 4 domains: number and types of joints inolved (max:5), serological abnormalities (max:3), presence of acute phase reactants (max:1), and duration (max:1).
