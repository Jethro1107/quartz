# Inferior view of the cranium
The base of the skull is seen in the inferior view and extends anteriorly from the middle incisor teeth posteriorly to the superior nuchal lines and laterally to the mastoid processes and zygomatic arches ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ).

Inferior view of the skull.

For descriptive purposes the base of the skull is often divided into:

- an anterior part, which includes the teeth and the hard palate,
- a middle part, which extends from behind the hard palate to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum, and
- a posterior part, which extends from the anterior edge of the foramen magnum to the superior nuchal lines.

## Anterior part
The main features of the anterior part of the base of the skull are the teeth and the hard palate.

The teeth project from the **alveolar processes** of the two maxillae. These processes are together arranged in a U -shaped alveolar arch that borders the hard palate on three sides ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ).

The **hard palate** is composed of the **palatine processes** of each maxilla anteriorly and the **horizontal plates** of each **palatine bone** posteriorly.

The paired palatine processes of each maxilla meet in the midline at the **intermaxillary suture** , the paired maxillae and the paired palatine bones meet at the **palatomaxillary suture** , and the paired horizontal plates of each palatine bone meet in the midline at the **interpalatine suture** .

Several additional features are also visible when the hard palate is examined:
- the **incisive fossa** in the anterior midline immediately posterior to the teeth, the walls of which contain **incisive foramina** (the openings of the **incisive canals** , which are passageways between the hard palate and nasal cavity);

- the **greater palatine foramina** near the posterolateral border of the hard palate on each side, which lead to **greater palatine canals** ;

- just posterior to the greater palatine foramina, the **lesser palatine foramina** in the **pyramidal process** of each palatine bone, which lead to **lesser palatine canals** ;

- a midline pointed projection (the **posterior nasal spine** ) in the free posterior border of the hard palate.

## Middle part
The middle part of the base of the skull is complex:
-   Forming the anterior half are the vomer and sphenoid bones.
- Forming the posterior half are the occipital and paired temporal bones.

### Anterior half
#### Vomer
Anteriorly, the small vomer is in the midline, resting on the sphenoid bone ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ). It contributes to the formation of the bony nasal septum separating the two choanae.

#### Sphenoid
Most of the anterior part of the middle part of the base of the skull consists of the sphenoid bone.

The sphenoid bone is made up of a centrally placed **body** , paired **greater and lesser wings** projecting laterally from the body, and two downward projecting **pterygoid processes** immediately lateral to each choana.

Three parts of the sphenoid bone, the body, greater wings, and pterygoid processes, are seen in the inferior view of the skull ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ). The lesser wing of the sphenoid is not seen in the inferior view.

##### Body
The body of the sphenoid is a centrally placed cube of bone containing two large air sinuses separated by a septum.

It articulates anteriorly with the vomer, ethmoid, and palatine bones, posterolaterally with the temporal bones, and posteriorly with the occipital bone.

##### Pterygoid processes
Extending downward from the junction of the body and the greater wings are the pterygoid processes ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ). Each of these processes consists of a narrow **medial plate** and broader **lateral plate** separated by the **pterygoid fossa** .

Each medial plate of the pterygoid process ends inferiorly with a hook-like projection, the **pterygoid hamulus** , and divides superiorly to form the small, shallow **scaphoid fossa** .

Just superior to the scaphoid fossa, at the root of the medial plate of the pterygoid process is the opening of the **pterygoid canal** , which passes forward from near the anterior margin of the foramen lacerum.

##### Greater wing
Lateral to the lateral plate of the pterygoid process is the greater wing of the sphenoid ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ), which not only forms a part of the base of the skull but also continues laterally to form part of the lateral wall of the skull. It articulates laterally and posteriorly with parts of the temporal bone.

Important features visible on the surface of the greater wing in an inferior view of the skull are the foramen ovale and the foramen spinosum on the posterolateral border extending outward from the upper end of the lateral plate of the pterygoid process.

### Posterior half
In the posterior half of the middle part of the base of the skull are the occipital bone and the paired temporal bones ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ).

#### Occipital bone
The occipital bone, or more specifically its **basilar part** , is in the midline immediately posterior to the body of the sphenoid. It extends posteriorly to the **foramen magnum** and is bounded laterally by the temporal bones.

Prominent on the basilar part of the occipital bone is the **pharyngeal tubercle** , a bony protuberance for the attachment of parts of the pharynx to the base of the skull ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ).

#### Temporal bone
Immediately lateral to the basilar part of the occipital bone is the petrous part of the petromastoid part of each temporal bone.

Wedge-shaped in its appearance, with its **apex** anteromedial, the petrous part of the temporal bone is between the greater wing of the sphenoid anteriorly and the basilar part of the occipital bone posteriorly. The apex forms one of the boundaries of the **foramen lacerum** , an irregular opening filled in life with cartilage ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ).

The other boundaries of the foramen lacerum are the basilar part of the occipital bone medially and the body of the sphenoid anteriorly.

Posterolateral from the foramen lacerum along the petrous part of the temporal bone is the large circular opening for the **carotid canal** .

Between the petrous part of the temporal bone and the greater wing of the sphenoid is a groove for the cartilaginous part of the **pharyngotympanic tube** ( **auditory tube** ). This groove continues posterolaterally into a bony canal in the petrous part of the temporal bone for the pharyngotympanic tube.

Just lateral to the greater wing of the sphenoid is the squamous part of the temporal bone, which participates in the temporomandibular joint. It contains the **mandibular fossa** , which is a concavity where the head of the mandible articulates with the base of the skull. An important feature of this articulation is the prominent **articular tubercle** , which is the downward projection of the anterior border of the mandibular fossa ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ).

## Posterior part

The posterior part of the base of the skull extends from the anterior edge of the foramen magnum posteriorly to the superior nuchal lines ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ). It consists of parts of the occipital bone centrally and the temporal bones laterally.

### Occipital bone
The occipital bone is the major bony element of this part of the base of the skull ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ). It has four parts organized around the foramen magnum, which is a prominent feature of this part of the base of the skull and through which the brain and spinal cord are continuous.

The parts of the occipital bone are the squamous part, which is posterior to the foramen magnum, the **lateral parts** , which are lateral to the foramen magnum, and the **basilar part** , which is anterior to the foramen magnum ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ).

The squamous and lateral parts are components of the posterior part of the base of the skull.

The most visible feature of the squamous part of the occipital bone when examining the inferior view of the skull is a ridge of bone (the external occipital crest), which extends downward from the external occipital protuberance toward the foramen magnum. The inferior nuchal lines arc laterally from the midpoint of the crest.

Immediately lateral to the foramen magnum are the lateral parts of the occipital bones, which contain numerous important structural features.

On each anterolateral border of the foramen magnum are the rounded **occipital condyles** ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ). These paired structures articulate with the atlas (vertebra CI). Posterior to each condyle is a depression (the **condylar fossa** ) containing a **condylar canal** , and anterior and superior to each condyle is the large **hypoglossal canal** . Lateral to each hypoglossal canal is a large, irregular **jugular foramen** formed by opposition of the **jugular notch** of the occipital bone and **jugular notch** of the temporal bone.

### Temporal bone
Laterally in the posterior part of the base of the skull is the temporal bone. The parts of the temporal bone seen in this location are the mastoid part of the petromastoid part and the styloid process ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ).

The lateral edge of the mastoid part is identified by the large cone-shaped mastoid process projecting from its inferior surface. This prominent bony structure is the point of attachment for several muscles. On the medial aspect of the mastoid process is the deep mastoid notch, which is also an attachment point for a muscle.

Anteromedial to the mastoid process is the needle-shaped styloid process projecting from the lower border of the temporal bone. The styloid process is also a point of attachment for numerous muscles and ligaments.

Finally, between the styloid process and the mastoid process is the stylomastoid foramen.
