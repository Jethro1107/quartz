# Somatosensory receptors
Somatosensory receptors mediate [[Somatosensation]]. 
They are classified into 3 types:
- Mechanoreceptors
- Thermoreceptors
- [[Nociceptors]]
### Mechanoreceptors
Mechanoreceptors are receptors that respond to mechanical deformation of local tissue, classified into **tactile receptors** and **proprioreceptors**.
##### Tactile receptors and the stimuli they detect
- Hair follicles
- Meissner corpuscle
- Merkel's disc
- Ruffini corpuscle
- Pacinian corpuscle
- Free nerve endings
##### Proprioreceptors and the stimuli they detect
- Golgi tendon organ ([[Golgi tendon reflex]])
- [[Physiological anatomy of a skeletal muscle#^dd3d23|Muscle spindles]]
- They are responsible for detection of position, movement and force of muscle contraction.
### Thermoreceptors
- Thermoreceptors (**Transient  receptor potential (TRP) receptors**) are receptors that respond to certain temperature ranges (and temperatures).

### Nociceptors
- Nociceptors (pain receptors) are **free nerve endings** that respond to actual or potential tissue damage.
