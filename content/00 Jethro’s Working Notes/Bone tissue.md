### Bone tissue

Bone tissue is a highly specialised connective tissue consisting of a ************mineralised************ extracellular matrix*****************, the bone matrix*****************, and 3 cell types:

- [[Osteoblast]] - They are involved in synthesizing the organic matrix and subsequent mineralization of it.
- [[Osteocyte]] - They are located within lacunae (cavities), surrounded by the bone matrix it synthesize.
- [[Osteoclast]]  - Bone macrophages, involved in the resporption of bone matrix.
