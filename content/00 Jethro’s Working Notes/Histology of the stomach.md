### Histology of the stomach
The stomach is also lined with [[The common histological layers of the GI tract]], namely, 1) the mucosa, 2) submucosa, 3) muscularis externa and 4) serosa.
- **Features of the mucosa of the stomach**
    At the *gastroesophageal junction*, the epithelial lining abruptly changes from the non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium in the oesophagus, into the **simple columnar epithelium of the stomach**.
    The simple columnar epithelium that lines the mucosa of the stomach *invaginates deeply into the lamina propria* to form [[Gastric pits and gastric glands]], note that [[The structure of the gastric pits and gastric glands varies between regions of the stomach]].
    The mucosa also consist of the lamina propria and the muscularis mucosae that borders the mucosa.

- **Features of the submucosa of the stomach**
    Together with the mucosa, the submucosa forms longitudinal folds (gastric rugae) in an empty stomach.
    
    Note that this feature is not to increase surface area for absorption (as the stomach is note the main site of absorption), but to enable the stomach to distend/increase its volume without an increase in pressure.

- **Features of the muscularis externa**
    The muscularis externa of the stomach consist of 3 sublayers instead of 2: 1) Innermost oblique muscles, 2) inner circular muscles, and 3) outer longitudinal muscles.
    The additional innermost oblique muscles may not be seen on certain sections of the stomach.
    The **inner circular muscle**, at the distal end of the pylorus, thickens to form a major part of the *pyloric sphincter*.
- Features of the serosa
    The stomach is lined by a thin layer of serosa.

The distinct histological feature of the stomach are the [[Gastric pits and gastric glands]], but [[The structure of the gastric pits and gastric glands varies between regions of the stomach]], i.e. the cardia, the body/fundus, and the pylorus of the stomach.
