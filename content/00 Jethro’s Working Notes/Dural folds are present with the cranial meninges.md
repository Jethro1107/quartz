# Dural folds are present with the cranial meninges
Dural folds are folds of [[Meninges#^7f341c|Inner meningeal layer of dura]] that *peels off the outer periosteal layer of dura*.

### Dual folds house venous sinuses (see [[Dural venous sinus]])
### Dural folds separate cranial cavity into compartments
There are 4 dural folds that separate cranium into compartments.
##### Falx Cerebri
- The falx cerebri is a *sickle-shaped dural fold* that *defines the left and right cerebral compartments*, separating the cerebrum into the left and right cerebral hemispheres.

##### Tentorium cerebelli
- The tentorium cerebelli is a *tent-shaped dural fold* that *defines the supratentorial compartment and infratentorial compartment*, separating the cerebral hemisphere from the [[Cerebellum]] and the [[Brainstem]].
- The edges of the two tentorium cerebelli forms the tentorium hiatus, form which the [[Brainstem]] passes through.
