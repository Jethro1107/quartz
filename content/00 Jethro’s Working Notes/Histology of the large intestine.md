### Histology of the large intestine
The large intestine consist of [[The common histological layers of the GI tract]], namely, the 1) Mucosa, 2) Submucosa, 3) Muscularis externa, 4) Serosa/adventitia

- **Features of the mucosa of the large intestine**
    The mucosa of the large intestine is lined with the same simple columnar epithelium, which extends deeply into the lamina propria to form the [[Crypts of Lieburkuhn (intestinal glands)]].
    
    Unlike the small intestine ([[Histology of the small intestine]]), the mucosa does not form intestinal villi. 
- **Features of the submucosa of the large intestine**
    The submucosa remains a dense irregular connective tissue with blood vessels and lymphatics. Unlike in the small intestine ([[Histology of the small intestine]]), the submucosa does not form pilcae circulares.
- **Features of the muscularis externa of the large intestine**
    The muscularis externa consist of the two sublayers: 1) inner circular muscles and 2) outer longitudinal muscles.
    There are 3 longitudinal bands of outer longitudinal muscles known as taeniae coli.
