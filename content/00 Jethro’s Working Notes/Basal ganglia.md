# Basal ganglia
The basal ganglia is one of the components of the extrapyramidal [[Motor system]].
### The basal ganglia consist of 5 motor nuclei
The 5 motor nuclei are 1) **Caudate nucleus**, 2) **Globus pallidus**, 3) **Putamen**, 4) **Subthalamic nucleus**, 5) [[Substantia niagra]].
The first 3 is found deep into the cerebrum.
##### Cuneate nucleus
The cuneate nucleus is located *immediately lateral to the [[Ventricular system#Lateral ventricles|Lateral ventricles]]*.
##### Globus pallidus
The globus pallidus is a small motor nucleus located lateral to the **internal capsule**, and medial to the Putamen.
It is subdivided into the globius pallidus internus, and globius pallidus externus.
##### Putamen
The putamen lies lateral to the globus pallidus.
##### Subthalamic nucleus
The subthalamic nucleus is located in the subthalamus of the diencephalon.
##### [[Substantia niagra]]
The substantial niagra is located ventrally of the [[Midbrain]], deep to the cerebral peduncle.

##### The collection of globus pallidus and putamen forms the **lentiforms**, and the collection of the 3 cerebral motor nucleus is called the **striatum** (or corpus striatum).
The communication between the caudate nucleus and putamen is broken up by the passage of [[Internal capsule]], resulting in a striated pattern of its fibres, hence, **corpus striatum**.
