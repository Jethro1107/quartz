# Lobes of the cerebral hemisphere
3 [[Gyri and sulci of the cerebral hemisphere|sulci]], the central sulcus, the lateral sulcus and the parieto-occipital sulcus help define the cerebral hemisphere into 4 lobes: 1) **Frontal lobe**, 2) **Parietal lobe**, 3) **Temporal lobe** and 4) **Occipital lobe**.
### 3 sulcus defines the 4 lobes
##### Lateral sulcus
The lateral sulcus is described as the *deepest, most conspicuous cleft on the lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere*, which divides the temporal lobe below from the frontal lobe and parietal lobe above.
The temporal lobe overlies cortical area deep to the lateral sulcus called the **insula**.
##### Central sulcus
While the name central sulcus may imply that it divides the cerebral hemisphere centrally into the frontal and parietal lobe, that is not the case.
The central sulcus can be found on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere, *as the continuation of the marginal branch of the cinguate sulcus*? #FC 
It can also as the *single sulcus that separates two parallel gyrus*, that is the precentral, and postcentral gyrus.
It divides the anterior **frontal lobe** from the posterior **parietal lobe**.
##### Parieto-occipital sulcus
The parieto-occipital sulcus can be viewed on the medial side of the cerebral hemisphere.
It divides the **parietal lobe** from the **occipital lobe**.
The parieto-occipital sulcus meets with the calcarine sulcus to define the primary visual cortex.
