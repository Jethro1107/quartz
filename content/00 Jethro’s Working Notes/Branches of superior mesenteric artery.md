# Branches of superior mesenteric artery
The superior mesenteric artery is an anterior [[Major branches of abdominal aorta]], at (L ). It gives off several branches that supply the small intestines ([[Anatomy of the small intestine]]) and parts of the large intestine ([[Anatomy of the large intestine]]).
### Branches of superior mesenteric artery
**Intestinal arteries** (15-18 jejunal and ileal arteries) - *passes through the mesentery of the small intestine*, and develop collateral blood supply by forming arterial arcades, with straight arteries vasa recta, supplying the gut wall.

**Middle colic artery** - Ascends retroperitoneally and *passes through the transverse mesocolon* to supply the proximal 2/3 of the transverse colon.

**Right colic artery** - Passes to the right retroperitoneally to supply the ascending colon.

**Iliocoliac artery** - The terminal branch of superior mesenteric artery. Descends to the right of the root of mesentery, where it branches into the colic branch and ileal branch.
- The Colic branch supplies the ascending colon and the cecum.
- The Ileal branch supplies the terminal ileum, and gives rise to the appendicular artery, which passes through the mesoappendix to supply the appendix.
