### Biliary secretion

- **Composition of bile**
    
    Biliary secretion consist of mostly water (97-98%), electrolytes, and organic components (bile salt, cholesterol, and bilirubin).
    

[[Bile is secreted in two phases in the liver]]. 

[[The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile]].

### Regulation of biliary secretion

Similar to pancreatic secretions, bicarbonate secretion by cholangiocytes is stimulated by secretin ([[Secretin stimulates copious release of bicarbonate secretions by ductal cells in the intestinal phase]]).

While bile is continuously secreted by hepatocytes and modified by cholangiocytes, most of it is stored within the gallbladder. [[Cholecystokinin controls gallbladder emptying]].
