# Posterior triangle of the neck
### Borders of the posterior triangle of the neck
The posterior triangle of the neck is roughly a triangular space:
- Its base is formed by the **middle 1/3 of the [[Clavicle]]**
- Its apex is formed by the back of the skull
- Its anterior margin is formed by the posterior edge of the **Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle**
- Its posterior margin is formed by the anterior edge of the **[[Trapezius]]**
- Its floor is formed by various muscles of the neck, while its roof is formed by the investing layer of the cervical fascia.

### Contents in the posterior triangle of the neck
##### Muscles
The floor of the posterior triangle is marked by various muscles of the neck:
- Anterior, middle, and posterior scalene muscles
- [[Levator scapulae]]
- Splenius capitus ([[Intrinsic back muscles]])
The omohyoid muscle, an [[Infrahyoid muscle]], found near the base of the posterior triangle of the neck, crosses under the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and emerges into the [[Anterior triangle of the neck]].
##### Veins
The external jugular vein and its tributaries are found in the posterior triangle of the neck.
##### Arteries
The [[Subclavian artery]] and its branches may be found in the posterior triangle of the neck:
- The 1st part of the subclavian artery lies anterior to the anterior and middle scalene muscles
- The 2nd part of the subclavian artery passes through the anterior scalene muscles
- The 3rd part of the subclavian artery emerges from the anterior and middle scalene muscles and gives off the suprascapular artery and the dorsal scapular artery that passes posterolaterally to participate at the [[Scapular anastamosis]].
##### Nerves
The [[Spinal accessory nerve (CN XI)]] is present superiorly.
The [[Brachial plexus#Trunks|Trunks of the brachial plexus]] emerges from the anterior and middle scalene muscles and passes into the posterior triangle fo the neck.
Some branches of the cervical plexus may be visible.
##### Lymph nodes
