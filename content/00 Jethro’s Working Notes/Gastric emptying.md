# Gastric emptying
Gastric emptying is the *slow, controlled release of chyme from the stomach into the duodenum, at a rate suitable for proper [[Digestive and absorption]] by the small intestine*.
- **Gastric emptying is is promoted by the pyloric pump and the relaxation of the pyloric sphincter**
    Pyloric pump is the intense constricting ring of contraction in the antrum (much stronger than the peristaltic contractions in [[Trituration - the mixing and propulsion of food in the stomach to give chyme]]), that pressurize the chyme, and squeezes the food through the pyloric opening into the duodenum.
    
    Pyloric sphincter, the thickened inner circular muscle layer in the stomach ([[Histology of the stomach]]), is normally tonically contracted, but its degree of contraction can be altered by gastric factors and intestinal factors, which regulate gastric emptying.

### Regulation of gastric emptying
- [[Gastric factors promote gastric emptying]]
- [[Intestinal factors inhibit gastric emptying]]
