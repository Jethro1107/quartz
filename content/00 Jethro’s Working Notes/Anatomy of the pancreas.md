### Anatomy of the pancreas

The pancreas is a (secondarily) retroperitoneal organ that lies posterior to the stomach.

### It consists of 4 parts
- Head - Which lies within the C-shaped concavity of the duodenum. The head of the pancreas lies to the right of the superior mesenteric vessels, and penetrated by the common bile duct. Projecting from the lower portions of the head is the uncinated process, which curls posterior to the **************superior mesenteric vessels.**************
- Neck - Which lies anterior to the superior mesenteric vessels, and is the site where the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein join to form the hepatic portal vein. Severe [[Pancreatitis]] can erode the superior mesenteric vessels, causing massive haemorrhage.
- Body - Which lies posterior to the stomach, extends from the neck to the tail.
- Tail - Which passes through the splenorenal ligament.

### The pancreas partakes in digestion via the production of [[Pancreatic secretions]], which drains via a network of ducts:
The main pancreatic duct originates from the tail of the pancreas, and drains [[Pancreatic secretions]] from the tail to the head. In the head, the main pancreatic duct passes inferiorly, and joins with the **Common bile duct** of the biliary system to form the **Apulla of Vater** (Pancreatoduodenal ampulla), which drains into the second part of the duodenum via the major duodenal papilla ([[Anatomy of the duodenum]]).

The Ampulla of Vater is surrounded by the **Sphincter of Oddi**, which is made of smooth muscle sphincter that is tonically contracted, and relax under the influence of Cholecystokinin ([[Cholecystokinin controls gallbladder emptying]]).

The accessory pancreatic duct drains into the second part of the duodenum via the minor duodenal papilla.

### Arterial supply of pancreas
The pancreas receives arterial supply by the splenic artery and the pancreatoduodenal artery.

In more detail, it is supplied by:
- The anterior and posterior superior pancreatic artery, which are branches of the gastroduodenal artery (branch of gastroduodenal artery).
- The dorsal and great pancreatic artery, which are branches of the splenic artery.
- The anterior and posterior inferior pancreatoduodenal artery, which are branches of the inferior pancreatoduodenal artery (a small branch of the superior mesenteric artery).

### Venous Drainage of the pancreas
The pancreas is drained by the splenic vein, which then drains into the hepatic portal vein.
### Innervation of the pancreas
Although the pancreas is regulated by vasomotor sympathetic and secretomotor parasympathetic nerve fibres, pancreatic secretion is mainly controlled by hormonal mechanisms (Refer to notes linked to [[Pancreatic secretions]]).
