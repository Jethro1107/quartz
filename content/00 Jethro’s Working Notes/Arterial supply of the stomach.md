### Arterial supply of the stomach
The stomach is supplied by the celiac trunk. Note that [[The celiac trunk gives rise to 3 branches]], where all are involved in supplying the stomach.

The three branches:
The **left hepatic artery**, which follows the lesser curvature of the stomach.
The splenic artery, which gives rise to the **left gastro-omental artery** that follows the greater curvature.
The common hepatic artery, which gives rise to the **right gastric artery**, which follows the lesser curvature of the stomach.
The common hepatic artery branches to give the hepatic artery proper, which branches to give the gastroduodenal artery. The gastroduodenal artery gives rise to the **right gastro-omental artery**.
