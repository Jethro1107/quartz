# That Dragon, Cancer
An interactive poetry from the Green family, as a memento to their 5 year old son, Joel, who has unfortunately passed away from AT/RT.
### Thoughts
In That Dragon, Cancer, one of the most compelling scene was in the chapter called “Dehydration”, where baby Joel started to vomit everything he eats and drinks. The scene was set in the hospital, where we played from the father’s perspective. Baby Joel has been crying non-stop, and despite all efforts of the father to try to get Joel to calm down, either by feeding him, soothing him, and even begging him, baby Joel kept crying.

Joel also started to refuse any forms of food or drinks, as he would vomit everything he ingests. This is particularly heartbreaking, as he wasn’t getting sufficient nutrition for his battle against cancer, almost as if he started to give up.

In “Dehydration”, we were actually allowed to move into the bathroom in the hospital room, where we encountered, once again the game console that appeared in the chapter “Joel the baby knight”. On the screen, it showed the prompt: Continue? But despite pressing every button, I was unable to restart the game to have another try against that dragon, Cancer. This served as a reminder of the limitations of the analogy of cancer as a video game. In video games, we were allowed to “Respawn” or retry after defeat, but in the “battle” against cancer, most don’t get a second chance.

Before this scene, despite being told that there were no actions I could take to change the fate of baby Joel, but during “Dehydration”, I’ve come to accept of the futility in baby Joel’s case, and there was nothing we could do to change it.

Cancer is a leading killer in the world. It follows that baby Joel’s family is not an isolated case. This game showed me that people do not go through grief after the loss of a loved one, but also in the anticipation of the loss of a loved one. When death, rather than convalescence seems to be the natural course of the disease, and nothing short of a miracle is required for the person to lose through, anticipatory grief can manifest as very potent emotions: Anger and depression, as portrayed by the father, denial, as portrayed by the mother. During clinical practice, one must be able to let the family members navigate these feelings, avoid potential dangers of these emotions. It’s easier said than done, but this game gave me a primer of what’s to expect in these situations.
