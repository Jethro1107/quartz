# Receptive fields
Receptive fields is a concept that describes *the area monitored by a single receptor cell*, e.g. [[Somatosensory receptors]].

Various somatosensory receptors have varying receptive field size, which determines **discriminatory touch**.
The larger the receptive field, the poorer it can localise the stimulus.
Hence, [[Two point discriminatory test demonstrates the effects of varying size of receptive fields and discriminatory touch]].
