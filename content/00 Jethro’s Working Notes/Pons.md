The pons is the middle structure of the [[Brainstem]].

### Surface anatomy of the Pons
- **Anterior features**
	- Anteriorly, the pons is characterised by the **trigeminal nerve**.
	- The basillary sulcus is also present, in association with [[Brain circulation#^20aa22|Basillary artery]].
- **Posterior features**
	- Posteriorly, the pons is characterised by the **superior cerebellar peduncle** and the **middle cerebellar peduncle**.

### Internal structures of the Pons
##### Descending pathways
- Ventrally, patchy bundles of corticospinal tract descend through the pontine trigeminal nucleus of [[Trigeminal nerve (CN V)]].
##### Ascending pathways
- [[Dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway]] - The medial lamniscus ascends dorsally, in a horizontal plane.
##### Cranial nerve nuclei
- Ventrally, the pontine nucleus is present.
- At the lower pons, the nucleus of the fascial nerve is located laterally, and the abducens nucleus is located medially.
- At the upper pons, the trochlear nucleus is located medially.
