# Flat muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall
The three flat muscles of the [[Anterolateral abdominal wall]]  are situated laterally, stacked on top of each other, proceeding from superficial to deep: External Oblique, Internal Oblique and Transversus Abdominis.

### External obliques
- The most superficial and largest flat muscle of the abdominal wall on either side of the midline.
- It originates from the 5th to 12th rib, and inserts onto the iliac crest.
- It’s fibres run *superolaterally to inferomedially*, where it form an aponeurosis which merges linea alba in front of the rectus abdominis

### Internal obliques
- The middle layer, and is much smaller and thinner than the external obliques
- It’s fibres run *inferolaterally to superomedially*, where it forms an aponeurosis near the midline which merges with the linea alba

### Transversus abdominis
- The deepest layer of the 3 flat muscles of the abdominal wall.
- It has a long line of origin, it originates from the costal margins of 6th-12th ribs, the thoracolumbar fascia, the medial aspect of the iliac crest, and inferiorly arises from a thickening of the iliopsoas fascia.
- Its fibres run transversely and forms an aponeurosis which merges with the linea alba.
- Deep to the transversus abdominis is the transversus fascia (the investing (deep) fascia of the transversus adominis).
