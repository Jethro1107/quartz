# Pathogenesis and pathology of osteoarthritis
### Pathogenesis of osteoarthritis
Abnormal loading at the joint (either by overloading or underloading), interfers with the nutrient cycle of the articular cartilage, as [[Nutrient cycle of the articular cartilage requires]].
- Underloading of the joint results in insufficient pressure to push synovial fluid into the joints, resulting in poor chondrocyte nutrition.
- Overloading of the joint cause direct death of chondrocytes.

With a disruption in nutrient cycle of articular cartilage, it results in destabilized cartilage homeostasis/ [[ECM homeostasis]]: Osteoarthritis starts when the degradation exceeds synthesis of [[Cartilage matrix]]. Hence, a defining feature of [[Osteoarthritis (Degenerative joint disorder)]], is the loss of articular cartilage, and radiologically presents with joint space narrowing ([[Kellgren and Lawrence system for classification of]]).

##### Changes in Articular cartilage
Degradation of articular cartilage exceeds synthesis of cartilage matrix. 

Stromolysin (MMP) breaks down type II collagen, which results in loss of collagen framework to restrict the swelling of the HA-aggrecan aggregates, resulting in entry of water into the cartilage, resulting in soft and swollen articular cartilage during arthroscopy.

As degeneration of the cartilage matrix continues, it results in fibrillations, cracks and erosions.

Eventually, there is loss of articular cartilage to the subchondral bone, resulting in eburnation.

##### Changes in subchondral bone
Loss of articular cartilage results in abnormal loading onto the bone:
- In response to abnormal load onto the bone, bone remodelling occurs to stabilize the joint.
- Osteophytes form at joint margins, and subchondral sclerosis occurs
- High stress on the bones, may cause the bones to crack. Fluid may move into the bone to form subchondral cyst.
### Histopathology of osteoarthritis
There is a progressive loss of articular cartilage, with fibrillations, cracks and eroision of cartilage.

In severe OA, eburnation (complete loss of articular cartilage) occurs.
