# Spinothalamic pathway
### Function of spinothalamic pathway
The spinothalamic pathway is an *ascending pathway* of [[Somatosensation]], involved in detection of temperature, pain, and light/crude/non-discrimintory touch.
- It receives signals from various receptors, such as **thermoreceptors**, **nociceptors** or **free nerve endings**, that are innervated by smaller diameter type A-delta sensory fibres and type C (unmyelinated) sensory fibres.
### Neuronal circuitry of spinothalamic pathway
1st order neurons (cell bodies within the dorsal root ganglia) receives signals from various somatosensory receptors from various parts of the body.
The central axon of 1st order neuron enters the spinal cord via the dorsal root, and *immediate bifurcate, extending rostrocaudally across 1-2 spinal levels in each direction*.
Axons of 1st order neurons *synapse with 2nd order neurons in dorsal gray horn of spinal cord at different spinal levels*, and immediately *decussate through the anterior white commisure* to the contralateral anterior or lateral **spinothalamic tract**.
Axons of 2nd order neurons ascend along the spinothalamic tract of the spinal cord and the [[Brainstem]].
Eventually within the [[Thalamus]], axons of 2nd order neurons synapse with 3rd order neurons within the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus.
Axons of 3rd order neurons project to the neurons of the somatosensory cortex.
