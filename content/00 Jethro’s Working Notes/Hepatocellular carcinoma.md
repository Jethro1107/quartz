### Hepatocellular carcinoma
- **What is hepatocellular carcinoma?**
    Hepatocellular carcinoma is the carcinoma arising from hepatocytes.
    It is the most common [[Primary liver tumours]] in the world.
- **Epidemiology of hepatocellular carcinoma**
- **Risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma**
    Risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma include:
    - Chronic HBV infection
    - Chronic HCV infection
    - Cirrhosis from chronic liver disease (irrespective of cause
    - Alcoholic steotohepatitis as a result of [[Alcoholic liver disease]] - Mainly via the pathway of cirrhosis
    - Non-alcoholic steotohepatitis (NASH) as a result of [[Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]] - Can directly predispose to HCC, and also indirectly via cirrhosis
    - Aflotoxin exposure
    - Metabolic disorders (e.g hereditary hemochromatosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Wilsonâ€™s disease)
- **Hepatocellular carcinoma - clinical**
- **Gross pathology of hepatocellular carcinoma**
    HCC may appear grossly as:
    1. Massive unifocal mass - Tumour is soft, hemorrhagic with frequent necrosis. Because of its high vascularity and minimal supportive stroma, it is prone to haemorrhage, rupture and peritoneal bleeding.

    2.  Multifocal nodular mass (usually indicating intrahepatic metastasis?)

    3. Diffuse type (inoperable)

    Tumours are often greenish in colour, due to bile production.
- **Histopathology of hepatocellular carcinoma**
    Well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma looks like normal hepatocytes that grow in thick trebaculae (ressembling the normal hepatocyte plates).
    Malignant cytological changes may be observed.

    Sometimes, clear cells (excessive glycogen storage) may be present in hepatocellular carcinoma.

- **Clinical features of hepatocellular carcinoma**
    Clinical features of hepatocellular carcinoma include:
    - Abdominal mass
    - Upper abdominal pain
    - Malaise, fatigue, weight loss
    - Occasionally presented with hypoglycemia, due to:
        1. Replacement of liver by tumour, causing deminished glycogen storage in the remaining part of the liver
        2. Clear cell type of HCC results in excessive storage of glycogen
        3. Secretion of insulin-like peptide by tumour cells
    Raised serum **alpha-fetoprotein** is common for hepatocellular carcinoma, *but is not sensitive*. It can be elevated in cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, germ cell tumors and even pregnancy.
- **Routes of metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma**
    The most common and important route of metastasis is hematogenous spread via venous invasion, i.e. HCC is prone to metastasis by venous invasion.

    Invasion into portal vein branches results in intrahepatic metastasis, whereas invasion into hepatic vein branches results in extrahepatic metastasis, mainly to the lungs and bones.
