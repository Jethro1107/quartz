### Ulna

The ulna forms part of the bony framework of the forearm. It occupies the medial position relative to the radius.

#### Classification of ulna
The ulna is a long bone.

#### Proximal end of the ulna
Note that the proximal end of the ulna is much larger than the proximal end of the radius.

The proximal end of the ulna is marked by the 1) Olecranon, 2) Coronoid process, 3) Trochlea notch and 4) Radial notch and 5) Ulnar tuberosity.

The *Olecranon* is the posterior bony projection that extends proximally from the ulna. 

The *Coronoid process* is the anterior bony projection that extends proximally from the ulna.

The *Trochlea notch*  is the superior surface of the proximal end of the ulna (contributed by the surface of the olecranon and coronoid process), that articulates with the pulley-shaped trochlea of the medial condyle of the humerus.

The *radial notch* is the lateral surface of the proximal end of the ulna that articulates with the head of the radius.

The *ulnar tuberosity* is an elevated region below the coronoid process for insertion of the [[Brachialis]].

All these structures cause the ulna to assume a wrench-like shape.

#### Distal end of the ulna (head)
The medial end is characterised by a bony projection that extends distally, the ulnar styloid process.
