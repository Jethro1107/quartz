### Cholangiocarcinoma

- **What is cholangiocarcinoma?**
    
    Cholangiocarcinoma is the carcinoma arising from the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. It is the second most common [[Primary liver tumours]], following [[Hepatocellular carcinoma]].
    

### Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma

- **Risk factors of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma**
    
    Large duct intracellular cholangiocarcinoma and small duct intracellular cholangiocarcinoma differ in risk factors.
    
    Large duct intracellular cholangiocarcinoma is mainly caused by chronic inflammatory *biliary* disease:
    
    - Liver flukes - Clonorchis sinesis, Opisthorchis viverrini. *In places where infestation by Liver flukes is endemic (e.g. Thailand, Laos, Cambodia), cholagiocarcinoma is much more common.*
    - Hepatothiasis - Stones in intrahepatic bile ducts
    - Primary sclerosising cholangitis (PSC) - An autoimmune disease characterised by inflammation and periductal fibrosis, resulting in stenosis or obliteration of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. The obliteration of bile ducts results in dilitation of proximal bile ducts. Billiary obliteration and dilitation results in charateristic ‘beading’ of biliary tree on MRI.

    Small duct intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is caused by chronic, *non-biliary, liver* disease:
    
    - Chronic HBV infections, cirrhosis, [[Alcoholic liver disease]] predispose to small duct intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
- **Gross pathology of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma**
    
    It is whitish colour and firm (due to the fibrous stroma within the tumour). This is in contrast to [[Hepatocellular carcinoma]], which is often soft, haemorrhagic with frequent necrosis.

- **Histopathology of cholangiocarcinoma**
    
    Cholangiocarcinoma consist of irregular glandular formations with copious fibrous stroma.

- **Routes of metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma**
    
    Cholangiocarcinoma mainly route of metastasis is via lymphatic spread to regional lymph nodes.
