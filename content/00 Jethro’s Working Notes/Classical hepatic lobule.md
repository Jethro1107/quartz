### What is the classical hepatic lobule?

The classical hepatic lobule is a rough hexagonal structure separated by the connective tissue stroma (not prominent in humans, where the peripheral region of the hepatic lobule is not well demarcated by a connective tissue layer). 

At each vertices is the portal triad ([[Histology of the portal triad]]), consisitng of the portal vein, hepatic artery and the bile duct.

At the centre of the classical hepatic lobule is the central hepatic vein, from which the hepatic artery and the hepatic portal vein of the portal triad drains into.

Plates of hepatocytes (epithelial cells, mono/bi-nucleated cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm) radiate towards the central vein. [[Hepatic sinusoids]] are located between the plates of hepatocytes.
