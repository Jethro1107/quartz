### Bone

Bone is made of [[Bone tissue]], which consist of [[Bone matrix]] and 3 cell types: [[Osteoblast]], [[Osteocyte]] and [[Osteoclast]]. Bone plays many functions ([[Functions of bones]].

### Gross examination of bone

On gross examination of the bone in the [[Skeletal system]], reveals [[5 types of bones by shape]]. Gross examination of a *************cross section************* of a bone may reveal 2 bone types: Compact bones and spongy bones ([[Compact bone and spongy bone differ by the presence of cavities]]).

### Histological examination of bone

[[Primary bone and secondary bone differ histologically]].

### Bone development

[[Osteogenesis]] occurs via 2 mechanisms: [[Intramembranous ossification]] and [[Endochondral ossification]].

Endochondral ossification also underlies elongation of long bones, enabled by an [[Epiphyseal plate]], and [[Bone repair]].
