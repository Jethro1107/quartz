# Direct-acting antivirals for HCV
Direct-acting antivirals are a new class of drug used in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, and can greatly shorten the duration of treatment.

### NS3/4A inhibitor
- **Examples of NS3/4A inhibitors**
    Simeprevir, Boceprevir, Telaprevir
- **MOA of NS3/4A inhibitors**
    NS3/4A inhibitor inhibits the protease and its confactor, thus prevents cleavage of polyprotein into functional proteins, thus inhibiting the viral cycle.
### NS5A inhibitors
- **Examples of NS5A inhibitors**
    Ledipasvir, Ombitasvir
- **MOA of NS5A inhibitors**
    NS5A inhibitors inhibit NS5A that is required for viral replication and assembly.
### NS5B inhibitors
- **Examples of NS5B inhibitors**
    Sofobuvir - NS5B nucleoside inhibitor
    Dasabuvir - NS5B non-nucleoside inhibitor
- **MOA of NS5B inhibitors**
    NS5B inhibitors inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thus inhibiting RNA replication and the viral cycle.
### NS3/4A inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors, NS5B NI and NS5N differ in terms of genotypical coverage, potency and barriers to resistance
