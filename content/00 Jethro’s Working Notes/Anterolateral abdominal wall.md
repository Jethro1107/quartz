### What is the Anterolateral abdominal wall?
The anterolateral abdominal wall is a musculo-aponeurotic structure, which differs from the [[Posterior abdominal wall]], which consist of the lumbar region of the vertebral column.
### Muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall
There are five muscles in the anterolateral abdominal walls, classified into:

- Two vertical muscles ([[Vertical muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall]] ) - Rectus abdominis and Pyramidalis
- Three flat muscles ([[Flat muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall]] )- External obliques, internal obliques and transversus abdominis

The two vertical muscles are located medially (situated near the midline of the body). whereas the three flat muscles are located laterally, stacked on top of each other.
Consider the [[Arterial supply and venous drainage of the anterolateral abdominal wall]], the [[Innervation of the anterolateral abdominal wall]] and the [[Lymphatic Drainage of the anterolateral abdominal ]] .
