# Brachial artery
The brachial artery is the continuation of the [[Axillary artery]] once it crosses the lower borders of the teres major.

### In the arm
 It descends along the groove between the [[Biceps brachii]] and [[Brachialis]], and somewhat superficial to the [[Coracobrachialis]].

The brachial artery supplies the muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm.

It also gives rise to an immediate branch, the deep (profundus) brachial artery, which accesses the posterior scapular region via the triangular interval and accompanies along the radial groove of the humerus to supply the posterior compartment of the arm.

### In the cubital fossa    
The brachial artery descends all the way into the [[Cubital fossa]], lies medially to the biceps tendon, and overlied by the bicipital aponeurosis.
