# Maxilla
The maxilla is a **paired** bone that forms part of the [[Viscerocranium]], forming the *bone of the upper jaw*.
### Parts of the maxilla
The maxilla has the **frontal process**, **zygomatic process**, **alveolar process** and the **palatine process**.
##### Frontal process
The frontal process projects up to the [[frontal bone]].
It forms the medial (and part of the inferior) border of the [[Orbit]].
##### Zygomatic process
The zygomatic process projects laterally to the zygomatic bone.
##### Alveolar process
The alveolar process projects inferiorly and bears the upper row of teeth.
##### Palatine process
The palatine process projects posteriorly (relatively inferiorly), and articulates with the palatine process of the contralateral maxillae.
It forms the part of the [[Hard palate]].

### Features of the maxilla
The **infraorbital foramen** is present for:
- The exit of the **maxillary** (V3) division of [[Trigeminal nerve (CN V)]], which emerges from the infraorbital foramen as the **infraorbital nerve**.
