# The motor homunculus roughly deleniates a map of repertoires of movement in the primary motor cortex
*In the 1950s, Penfield and Rasmussen described the topographical organisation of the primary motor cortex to different areas of the body, the Motor Homunculus*.

The motor honunculus roughly divides area over the primary motor cortex, that roughly deleniates a map of repertoire of movements in the primary motor cortex.

Most medially, a small area of primary motor cortex is responsible for movement of the **lower limb**. 
This is followed by a small area for the trunk.
Proceeding laterally, is an area responsible for movement of the **upper limb**, with a particularly *large area for the distal areas (hand)*.
Most laterally, is a relatively large area of the primary motor cortex is responsible for the face and speech functions.

However, in reality, size of different areas is highly variable. Hence, the areas of primary motor cortex is still mapped out by electrical stimulation and recording during neurosurgical operations.
