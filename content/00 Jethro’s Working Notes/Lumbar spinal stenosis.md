# Lumbar spinal stenosis
Lumbar spinal stenosis refers to the narrowing of the spinal canal, or the intervertebral foramina at the lumbar canal.
### Pathoanatomy of lumbar spinal stenosis
Refer to the features of the lumbar spine ([[Structure of a typical vertebrae]], [[Features of lumbar vertebrae]], [[Ligaments of the vertebral column]]).
Stenosis can occur in the foraminal area, lateral recess, and central area of the spinal canal, which can result in compression of nerve roots at different spinal levels.

Causes of lumbar spinal stenosis include:
- IV disc herniation ([[Degenerative change in intervertebral disc underlies disc herniation]]), which may be foraminal, lateral or central.
- Osteophyte formation
- Facet joint hypertrophy, which may cause lateral compression or central compression.
- Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy
### Clinical features of lumbar spinal stenosis
[[Neurogenic claudication]] is the hallmark feature of lumbar spinal stenosis (as it results in cauda equina lesions).
Claudication is characterised with burning numbness in the lower limb when walking, but is relieved when rest.
It is also characterised with spasm in the calf muscles.
