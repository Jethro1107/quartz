### The common histological layers of the GI tract

- Histologically, different parts of the GI tract share the same four histological layers: 1) Mucosa, 2) Submucosa, 3) Muscularis externa and 4) Serosa/Adventitia.
- **Features of the mucosa**
    - The mucosa is lined with an **epithelium** - The epithelium starts as a non-karatinised stratified squamous epithelium in the oesophagus (to protect against abraisions), which abruptly changes into a simple columnar epithelium at the stomach (for absorption and secretion functions).
    - Underneath the epithelium, is the **lamina propria** - The lamina propria is a loose connective tissue consisting of small blood vessels, lymphatics and small glands.
    - **Muscularis mucosae** - A thin layer of longitudinally-arranged smooth muscle that separates the mucosa and the submucosa.
    It should be noted that the mucosa varies considerably from region to region of the GI tract.

- **Features of the submucosa**
    - The submucosa is formed mainly by a dense irregular connective, consisting of larger blood vessels and lymphatics.
    - The submucosa also consist of the submucosal (Meissner) plexus, which part of the [[Enteric nervous system]]. The Meissner plexus regulates secretomotor functions, regulating secretion of mucosal glands and motility of the muscularis mucosae.
    - **Mucous glands** are only present in the oesophagus (as oesophageal glands) and in the duodenum (as duodenal glands).

- **Features of the muscularis externa**
    - The muscularis externa is a thick muscularis of smooth muscles organised into two sublayers:
        - Inner circular muscles (ICM) - The inner sublayer where fibres orientation is circular, i.e. perpendicular to the direction of the GI tract
        - Outer longitudinal muscles (OLM) - The outer sublayer where fibres orientation are longitudinal, i.e. perpendicular to the direction of the GI tract
    - Between the two sublayers, is the myenteric (Auerbach) plexus, consisting of autonomic neurons organised into nerve ganglia and interconnected pre- and post-ganglionic nerve fibres. The Auerbach plexus regulates motor functions, coordinating the contraction of the muscularis externa to mix food and push it down the GI tract, i.e. [[Peristalsis]].
    - Note that the Meissner and Auerbach plexus comprise the *[[Enteric nervous system]]*.

- **Features of the serosa/adventitia**
    - Serosa - A thin layer of loose connective tissue covered by a layer of simple squamous epithelium (mesothelium), which is the parietal peritoneum in gross anatomy. Only intraperitoneal organs are covered by the serosa.
    - Adventitia - A thick layer of connective tissue with no mesothelial lining that is continuous wit h surrounding tissue. Only the oesophagus (as it is not located in the abdominal cavity) and retroperitoneal organs are covered by the adventitia.

The same 4-layered histological organisation of the GI tract holds true for the entire GI tract. However, different parts of the GI tract have distinct histological features that aids their function (See: ).
