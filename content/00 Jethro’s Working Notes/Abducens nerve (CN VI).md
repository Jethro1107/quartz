### Functional component and functions of the abducens nerve
The abducens nerve consist of a somatic motor component, providing motor innervation to the lateral rectus muscle of the eye.
It enables *abduction of the eye*.
### Abducens nucleus
The abducens nucleus is located at the lower pons, dorsomedially.
### Defects of abducens nerve
Defects in abducens nerve results in:
- **Diplopia** (Double vision)
- **Medial deviation of the eye**
- Failure to abduct the affected eye
