# Occulomotor nerve (CN III)
### Course of occulomotor nerve
The occulomotor nerves emerge from the **interpeduncular fossa of the [[Midbrain]]**, and courses between the [[Brain circulation#^488baa|posterior cerebral arteries]], and the [[Brain circulation#^b6a2a0|superior cerebellar arteries]], and continues its course into the [[Carveneous sinus]], and passes into the [[Orbit]] via the superior orbital fissure.
### Functions and functional component of occulomotor nerve
Oculomotor nerve pocesses **somatic sensory** and **visceral sensory** component:
- *Somatic sensory component are involved in innervating the 4/6 of [[Extraoccular muscles]]*: Superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus and inferior oblique, and the levator palpebrae superioris (an eyelid muscle).
- Hence, it is responsible for raising the eyelid, and turning the eyes upward, downward, medially.

- *Visceral sensory components are involved in* the [[Pupillary light reflex]] and [[Accomodation reflex]].
- Preganglionic parasympathetic fibres arising from **Edinger-Westphal nucleus** synapse at the **ciliary ganglion**, and innervates the constrictors of pupils and ciliary muscles.
### Cranial nerve nuclei of occulomotor nerve
The occulomotor nerve consist of 2 nucleus:
**Main occulomotor nucleus**
The main occulomotor nucleus is located anterior to the periaqueductal gray in the [[Midbrain]], at the level of the superior colliculus.
**Edinger-Westphal nucleus**
The Edinger-Westphal nucleus is located posterior to the main occulomotor nucleus in the periaqueductual gray.

### Defects of occulomotor nerve defects
Defects of occulomotor nerve results in:
- **Opthalmoplegia**, causing the eye to deviate downward and outward and **ptosis**, drooping of upper eyelid.
- **Mydriasis**, loss of pupillary light reflex and accomondation reflex.
