### Pectoral girdle
The pectoral girdle consist of the [[Clavicle]] and [[Scapulae]] (joined at the [[Acromioclavicular joint]]). It forms part of the bony framework of the shoulder ([[Regions of the upper limb]]).

#### Movement of the pectoral girdle
The [[Acromioclavicular joint]] holds the clavicle and scapulae together, such that the clavicle and the scapulae move as a unit.
- Elevation and depression
- Protraction and retraction - During protraction, the medial borders of the scapulae move apart. During retraction, medial borders of the scapulae move together.
- Scapulae rotation (Upward rotation and downward rotation)
