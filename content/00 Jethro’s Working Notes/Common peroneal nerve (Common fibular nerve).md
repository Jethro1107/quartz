### Common peroneal nerve
The common peroneal nerve (or common fibular nerve) is formed by the posterior divisions of L4 to S3.

Proximal to the [[Popliteal fossa]], the [[Sciatic nerve]] branches to give the common peroneal nerve, which descends along the medial borders of the biceps femoris.

Once it leaves the popliteal fossa, it wraps around the neck of the fibula, and branches into the superficial fibular nerve and the deep fibular nerve.

    The superficial fibular nerve descends along the lateral compartment of leg, and supplies the muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg, the peroneus longus and the peroneus brevis.
    
    In the foot, the superficial fibular nerve branches into the intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve of the foot, and the medial dorsal cutaneous nerve of the foot, which provides: ^bc8f80
    - Sensory innervation to the dorsum of the foot, except for the web of skin between the 1st and 2nd digits.
- ************************************Deep fibular nerve************************************
    The deep fibular nerve passes anteromedially and descends deep to the extensor digitorum longus. It supplies muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg.
    
    In the foot, the deep fibular nerve innervates the extensor digitorum brevis, contributes to innervation of the 1st and 2nd dorsal interossei of the foot, and the web of skin between the 1st and 2nd digit.
