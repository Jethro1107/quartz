# Cranial nerves
Cranial nerves are nerves arising from the brain, that supply mostly the head and neck region (with the exception of the vagus nerve).
### The 12 pairs of cranial nerves

1. [[Olfactory nerve (CN I)]]
2. [[Optic nerve (CN II)]]
3. [[Occulomotor nerve (CN III)]]
4. [[Trochlear nerve (CN IV)]]
5. CN V - Trigeminal nerve
6. [[Abducens nerve (CN VI)]]
7. CN VII - Fascial nerve
8. CN VIII - Vestibulochochlear nerve

### Functional components of cranial nerves
There are 6 functional components (neurons) of cranial nerves:
- Sensory (**afferent**) components:
	1. Somatosensory (general somatic sensory) - For [[Somatosensation]], conveys touch, pressure, vibration, proprioception, temperature and pain sensations.
	2. Visceral sensory - Perceives sensory imputs from viscera (internal organs), except for pain
	3. Special sensory - Perceives the 5 special senses, *sight, smell, taste, hearing, balance*.
- Motor (**efferent**) components:
	1. Somatic motor - Innervates muscles developed from somites.
	2. Branchial motor - Innervates muscles developed from branchial (pharyngeal arch).
	3. Visceral motor - Innervates viscera, including glands, cardiac muscles, smooth muscles.
Some cranial nerves are pure sensory nerves ();
Some cranial nerves are pure motor nerves ();
Some cranial nerves are mixed nerves.
