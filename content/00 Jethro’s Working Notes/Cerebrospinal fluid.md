# Cerebrospinal fluid
**Cerebrospinal fluid** is an ultrafiltrate of plasma produced from [[Choroid plexus]] of the [[Ventricular system]].
There is roughly 150ml of *clear, colourless* CSF in adults, 2/3 is present within the spine.

### Composition of CSF
CSF is a clear and colourless fluid that has similar composition as plasma, but with:
- Minimal protein
- 2/3 of glucose in blood
- No red blood cells
- Little white blood cells (<5/mm3)
- Less Ca2+ and K+
- More Cl-
An increase in protein and decrease in glucose contents in CSF may indicate a bacterial CNS infection/ meningitis.

### Functions of CSF
1. **Bouyancy** - CSF provides mechanical bouyancy and support for the brain
2. **Protection** - CSF serves as a shock absorber/ cushion to protect the [[Central nervous system]] from trauma
3. **Homeostasis** - CSF maintains a stable physical and biochemical environment
4. **Removal of metabolic waste** - Metabolic wastes produced by neurons drains from glymphatics into CSF, which then returns to blood via the [[Cerebrospinal fluid pathway]].
