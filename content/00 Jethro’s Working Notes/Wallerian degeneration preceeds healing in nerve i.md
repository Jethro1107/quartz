In classes of nerve injury with axon discontinuity (axonotmesis and neurotmesis in [[Seddon and Sunderland classification of nerve injury]]), **Wallerian degeneration** preceeds healing.

### The steps in details
 After a nerve injury with axon discontinuity, Wallerian degeneration of the nerve distal to injury occurs. Macrophages come in the phagocytose and clear the cell debris.

Healing then proceeds:
- Schwann cells proliferate and regenerate the myelin tunnel.
- Axon sprouts and finds its way through the tunnel, at a speed of roughly 1mm per day.

With good apposition, full recovery is expected.
But with poor apposition, a disorganised nodule of axon sprouts, a traumatic neuroma will be formed.
