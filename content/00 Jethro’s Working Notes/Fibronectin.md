### Fibronectin

Fibronectin is a multiadhesive glycoprotein that is secreted by cells into the [[Extracellular matrix]].

- **************************************************************************Structure and function of fibronectin**************************************************************************
    
    Its functional form is a dimer, maintained by disulphide bond.
    
    *It has extensive binding capacity*, consisting domains that can bind to collagen, heparan sulphate proteoglycans, fibrin, and consist of the **************************************RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate) motif that binds to integrin receptors************************************** ([[Integrins interact with the extracellular matrix via RGD motif]]).
