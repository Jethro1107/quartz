### Anatomy of the upper limb
The upper limb, also known as the upper extremity, is part of the appendicular skeleton that extends from shoulder to the tip of our fingers. It is a body region that is lateral to the inferior aspect of the neck and the thorax.

[[Regions of the upper limb]]  is based on the joints and component bones, and is roughly divided into the shoulder, arm (brachium), forearm (Antebrachium) and hand. The cubital fossa is a depressed region in the transition between the arm and forearm.
### Bones and joints of the upper limb
As mentioned, the upper limb can be classified into the shoulder, arm, forearm and hand, which is based on the joints and component bones.

The bony framework of the shoulder is made of:
- the [[Pectoral girdle]], which consist of the [[Clavicle]] and the [[Scapulae]]
- the proximal end of the humerus

Important joints of the shoulder include:
- The [[Sternoclavicular joint]], the only joint that joins the pelvic girdle to the axial skeleton
- The [[Acromioclavicular joint]]
- The [[Shoulder joint (Glenohumeral joint)]]

The bony framework of the arm is made of:
- The [[Humerus]]

Important joints of the arm include:
- [[Elbow joint]], which consist of 3 articulations enclosed within the same synovial cavity

The bondy framework of the forearm is made of:
- the [[Radius]] and [[Ulna]]

Important joints of the forearm include:
- [[Proximal and distal radioulnar joint]]s
- [[Wrist joint (radiocarpal joint)]]

Note the bony framework of the hands ([[Bones of the hand and the arches of the hand]]), and its important joints ([[Joints of the hand]]). Particularly, the [[Carpometalcarpal joint of the thumb]] works independently from the carpometacarpal joint of the rest of the digits.

### Muscles of the upper limb
Muscles that move the pectoral girdle - [[Trapezius]], [[Levator scapulae]], [[Rhomboid major and minor]], [[Serratus anterior]], [[Pectoralis minor]]. [[Subclavius]]
Muscles that move the arm/shoulder joint - [[Deltoid]], [[Latissimus dorsi]], [[Pectoralis major]], [[Rotary cuff muscles]]. [[Teres major]]. [[Coracobrachialis]]

Muscles of the arm/ that move the elbow joint:
- The arm is separated into the two compartments, the anterior compartment (which consist of anterior flexor group), and the posterior compartment (which consist of the posterior extensor group). The two compartments are separated by the medial and lateral itermuscular septum.
- Anterior flexor group - [[Coracobrachialis]], [[Biceps brachii]], [[Brachialis]]
- Posterior extensor group - [[Triceps brachii]], [[Anconeus]]

Muscles of the forearm:
- The forearm is classified into the anterior compartment of the forearm, and posterior compartment of the forearm. The two compartments are separated by the interosseous membrane and fascia of the muscles and associated intermuscular septum. Note that the posterior group seeps into the anterior group on the lateral side, due to the brachioradialis.
    - [[Anterior compartment of the forearm]]
    - [[Posterior compartment of the forearm]]

Muscles of the hand:

- The intrinsic muscles of the hands can be largely classified into 5 groups:
    - [[Thenar muscles]]
    - [[Adductor pollicus]]
    - [[Hypothenar muscles]]
    - [[Lumbricals]]
    - [[Interossei muscles]]

### Innervation of the upper limb

The upper limb is innervated by the [[Brachial plexus]]

### Vascular supply of the upper limb
**Arterial supply of the upper limb**
Arterial supply of the upper limb starts with the [[Axillary artery]], which is the continuation of the subclavian artery once it enters the axillary inlet ([[Axilla]]), and terminates at the lower borders of the [[Teres major]].

The axillary artery then continues as the [[Brachial artery]], which branches into the [[Ulnar artery]] and the [[Radial artery]].

**Deep veins of the upper limb follow the naming convention of the arterial supply of the upper limb.**

[[Superficial veins of the upper limb]] 

### Regional anatomy

[[Regions of the upper limb]] include the shoulder, the arm, the forearm and the hand.

The [[Cubital fossa]] serves as a transition between the arm and the forearm.

The hand consist of 2 important spaces, the [[Carpal tunnel]], and the [[Anatomical snuffbox]].
