# Dural venous sinus
Dural venous sinus are found within [[Dural folds are present with the cranial meninges|Dural folds]], and is responsible for receiving venous blood from cerebral veins, and [[Cerebrospinal fluid pathway#Reabsorption|Reabsorption of CSF]]. 

### Superior sagital sinus
The superior sagital sinus is found at the upper margins of [[Dural folds are present with the cranial meninges#Falx Cerebri|Falx cerebri]].
It receives venous drainage from the **superior cerebral veins**, and drains into the confluence of sinuses, and usually into the **right transverse sinus**.
### Inferior sagittal sinus
The inferior sagittal sinus is found at the lower margins of Falx cerebri.
It joins the **paired great cerebral veins** and drains into **straight sinus**.
### Straight sinus
The straight sinus is found at the junction of the Falx cerebri and the attachment of the [[Dural folds are present with the cranial meninges#Tentorium cerebelli|Tentorium cerebelli]], and is formed by the union of the great cerebral veins and the inferior sagittal sinus.
It drains into the transverse sinus.
### Transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus
The transverse sinus can be found within the the [[Dural folds are present with the cranial meninges#^78655b|Tentorium cerebelli]] and drains into the sigmoid sinus, which drains into the internal jugular vein.
### [[Carveneous sinus]]
