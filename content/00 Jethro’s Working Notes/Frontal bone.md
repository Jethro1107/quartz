# Frontal bone
The frontal bone forms a part of the [[Neurocranium#Calvaria|Calvaria of the neurocranium]].
It forms the bone of the forehead.
### Features of the frontal bone
The frontal bone forms the superior border of the [[Orbit]].
Superior to the borders of the orbit, there is an elevation called the **supraciliary arch**, roughly at the level of the eybrow.
The 2 supraciliary arches are joined by a small depression in between, called the **glabella**.
Medially to the superior border of the orbit, is marked by the **supraorbital notch**, which is for:
- The passage of **supraorbital VAN**
- The passage of **supratrochlear VAN**
