# Smaller size of receptive fields and lateral inhibition facilitates spatial discrimination and localisation of stimuli
### Smaller size of [[Receptive fields]]
Smaller size of receptive fields enables better localisation of stimuli (spatial discrimination).
### Lateral inhibition
Lateral inhibition facilitates localisation of stimuli, in [[Somatosensation]], as well as special sensations such as Vision and hearing.

Receptive fields are often overlapped, such that stimulation of a receptive field maximally will invariably result in stimulation of neighbouring units:
- The central unit is maximally activated, while surrounding units are submaximally activated.
The maximally activated receptive fields stimulate inhibitory interneurons, that inhibits surrounding neighbouring units, preventing them from stimulating the [[Somatosensory pathways are generally organised in a 3 neuron system#2nd order neurons|2nd order neurons]] for their receptive fields.
As a result, this *accentuates contrast* of signals between the central and peripheral receptor fields, enabling us to *pin-point the stimulus*.
