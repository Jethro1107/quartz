# Medulla
The medulla is the inferior structure of the [[Brainstem]].

### Surface anatomy of the medulla
The medulla oblongata is characterised by various structures.
- **Anterior features**
	- The medulla is characterised by the two **medullary pyramids**, separated by the anterior medial fissure, conveying the **corticospinal tracts**.
	- Anteriorly, the medulla is characterised by the **anterior medial fissure**, which extends down the spinal cord.
	- Many [[Cranial nerves]] extend from the anterior surface of the medulla.
- **Lateral features**
	- Laterally, the medulla is characterised by the olive, which consists of the **inferior olivary nucleus**.
- **Posterior features**
	- Posteriorly, the medulla is characterised by the posterior medial fissure.
	- It also consists of the **gracile tubercle** medially, and the **cuneate tubercle** laterally.
		- These are bumps on the dorsal medulla, that consists of the **nucleus gracilis** and **nucleus cuneatus** respectively (housing 2nd order neurons of the [[Dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway|Dorsal column medial lamniscus system]].

### Components of the medulla
##### Descending pathways
The corticospinal tract descends ventrally in the **medullary pyramids** and subsequently *decussate at the junction of the junction between the medulla and the spinal cord.*

##### Ascending pathways
[[Dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway]] - At the lower and middle pons, 2nd order neurons within the **Nucleus gracilis** medially and **Nucleus cuneatus** in the lower and middle medulla projects axons that *decussate to the contralateral medial lemniscus*, which ascend *ventrally, medially, and in a vertical plane*.

The [[Spinothalamic pathway|Spinothalamic tract]] ascends laterally, posterior to the olive and anterior to the inferior cerebellar peduncle.

##### Cranial nerve nuclei
The **hypoglossal nucleus** (CN XII), **dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMX)** (CN X), **vestibular nucleus** the **nucleus ambiguus** can be found grouped around the central canal dorsally, forming the floor of the [[Ventricular system#4th ventricle|4th ventricle]].
- The **hypoglossal nucleus** sends nerve fibres that pass between the pyramids and the inferior olivary nucleus to and emerges as the **hypoglossal nerve**, *between the olive and medullary pyramids*.
The **inferior olivary nucleus** is found in the **olive** of the medulla oblongata.
The **nucleus of trigeminal nerve** (spinal trigeminal nucleus of [[Trigeminal nerve (CN V)]]) is found laterally at the lower and middle medulla.
