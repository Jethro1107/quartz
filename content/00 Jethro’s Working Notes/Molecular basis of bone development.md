up: [[Limb development]]

### Limb development and formation of skeletal elements of the limbs

Limbs are developed from the lateral plate mesoderm, forming buds that extend proximo-distally. The mesenchymal tissue then establishes the skeletal element of the limbs, through the [[4 phases of skeletal morphogenesis]].

### Limb patterning

During skeletal morphogenesis the limb is patterned in the proximal-distal axis, anterior-posterior axis and dorsal-ventral axis. These are regulated by different mechanisms.

- Proximo-distal patterning is regulated by FGF signalling
- [[Anteroposterior patterning (patterning of digits) is regulated by sonic hedgehog [[signalling]] ]]
- Dorsoventral patterning is regulated by Wnt signalling

### Molecular mechanisms in regulating bone growth

Bone growth requires chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy in the [[Epiphyseal plate]] to provide a continuous source of calcified cartilage for [[Endochondral ossification]]. The extent of proliferation and hypertrophy is regulated by:

- [[Chondrocyte proliferation in the epiphyseal plate is regulated by FGF signalling, particularly FGF-FGFR3 signalling]]
- [[Chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy in epiphyseal plate is regulated by the IHH PTHrP negative feedback loop]]
