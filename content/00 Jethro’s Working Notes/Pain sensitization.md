# Pain sensitization
Pain sensitization refers to the process to which tissue damage results in reduced threshold to pain stimulus of [[Nociceptors]].
This results in either allodynia or hyperalgesia:
- **Allodynia** is the pain sensation to innoculous stimulus.
- **Hyperalgesia** is the increase in pain sensation to noxious stimulus.
### Peripheral pain sensitization
Damaged tissue releases various chemicals, such as *bradykinin, prostaglandins, H+, lactic acid, and 5-HT*, which can either activate or sensitize [[Nociceptors]].
Furthermore, nociceptors release substance P and calcitonin-gene related proteins (CGRP), which mediates inflammation, and triggers histamine release by mast cells, which further sensitize nociceptors.
This results in primary hyperalgesia.
As these chemical spreads to nearby tissues, it results in secondary hyperalgesia.

### Central pain sensitization
Inflammation triggers release of **nerve growth factor** by fibroblasts, which is taken up by the nociceptors.
Via axonal transport to the cell bodies, it triggers expression of **brain-derived neurotrophic factors**, which is released at the axons, increasing excitability of 2nd order neurons in the dorsal horn.
