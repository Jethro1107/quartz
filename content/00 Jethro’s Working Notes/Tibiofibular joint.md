    The superior tibiofibular joint is the articulation between the head of the [[Femur]]  and the lateral condyle of the [[Tibia]] .

**The interosseous border of the tibia and fibula are connected by interosseous membrane.**

- **Inferior tibiofibular joint**
    
    The inferior tibiofibular joint is a fibrous joint, or a syndesmosis. It consist of a fibrous structure that enables the distal ends of the tibia and fibula to form a notch-like structure for the insertion of the tallus ([[Bones of the foot and the arches of the foot]]), forming a stable [[Ankle joint]].
