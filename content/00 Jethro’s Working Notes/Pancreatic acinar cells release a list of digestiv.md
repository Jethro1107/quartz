### Pancreatic acinar cells release a list of digestive enzymes upon stimulation

Pancreatic acinar cells release a list of digestive enzymes upon stimulation. These enzymes can be classified into:

- Inactive zymogens - Trypsin, Chymotrypsin, Proelastase and Procarboxypeptidase A and B ([[The pancreas release a list of zymogens for protein digestion]])
- Active enzymes - Pancreatic amylase ([[Salivary alpha-amylase and pancreatic alpha-amylase are involved in the digestion of starch]]), Pancreatic lipase [[Pancreatic lipase mediates physiologically significant fat digestion in the small intestine]]), phospholipase, cholesteryl esterase, DNAase and RNAase ([[Digestion of nucleic acids]]).
