# Trochlear nerve (CN IV)
### Course of trochlear nerve
The trochlear nerve within the [[Pons]], immediately *decussate to the contralateral side*.
The trochlear nerve emerges from the *dorsal surface of the [[Midbrain]]*, inferior to the **inferior colliculus**.
It wraps around the midbrain, emerging into the **middle cranial fossa**, and passes through the [[Carveneous sinus]].
It enters the [[Orbit]] through the superior orbital fissure.
### Functional component and functions of trochlear nerve
The trochlear nerve has a somatic motor component, and provides motor innervation to the *contralateral superior oblique muscle* of the eye.
It enables *intorsion*, and *depression of the adducted eye*.
### Trochlear nuclei
The trochlear nuclei is located anterior to the periaqueductal gray of the [[Midbrain]], at the level of the **inferior colliculus**.

### Defects in trochlear nerve
Defects in trochlear nerve results in:
- **Diploma** (double vision)
- **Extorsion of affected eye**, compensated by head tilt to unaffected side
- Failure to depress the adducted eye
