### Osteogenesis

Osteogenesis is the formation of bones, which can be via 2 ways:

- [[Intramembranous ossification]] - Involved in the formation of flat bones in the skull during embryological development.
- [[Endochondral ossification]] - Involved in the formation of long bones and short bones during embryological development, bone growth (elongation of long bones), and bone repair.
