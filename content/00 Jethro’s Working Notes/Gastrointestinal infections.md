# Gastrointestinal infections
### Approach to gastrointestinal infections:
- There are different gastrointestinal infective syndromes, each with a specific group of microbes that cause the syndromes.
- The incubation period, symptomatology and exposure history enables us to delineate the infective syndromes and thus narrow down the etiological microbe.
- A number of investigations is carried out for [[Microbiological diagnosis of Enteric Infections]].

### Classification of gastrointestinal infections:
- [[Non-inflammatory enteric infections]]  - Vomiting, Watery Diarrhoea
    - Non-inflammatory gastrointestinal infections are enterotoxin (particularly secretory toxin) mediated. As it does not involve an inflammatory response, leukocyte is negative on stool examination.
- [[Inflammatory enteric infections]] - Dysentery, Bloody diarrhea
- Penetrating enteric infections - [[Enteric fever]]
- Antibiotic-associated diarrhea - Etiology can be non-infective (caused by the antibiotic) or infective, commonly caused by Clostridium difficicle ([[Clostridium difficile colitis]]).
