# Cerebral hemisphere
The cerebral hemisphere is the embryological tenencephalon, and refers to the largest part of the brain. It is comprised of the superficial gray matter, [[Cortex]], the internal masses of gray matter, namely the Striatum of [[Basal ganglia]] (The thalamus is a part of the diencephalon and is not part of the cerebral hemisphere, but a part of the cerebrum).
### Surface anatomy of the cerebral hemisphere
The surface of the cerebral hemisphere is not smooth, but is marked by elevations and grooves called [[Gyri and sulci of the cerebral hemisphere]]. These gyruses and sulci define the [[Lobes of the cerebral hemisphere]], and the important gyri.
### Organization of the cerebral hemisphere
##### Cortical gray matter
- The cerebral hemisphere is made of the superficial [[Cortex]] that runs along the [[Gyri and sulci of the cerebral hemisphere]], which houses the neurons.
##### White matter of cerebral hemisphere
- The neurons within the cortex sends axons that forms much of the white matter that is arranged in a fan-like arrangement, the **corona radiata**.
- A vast majority of the axons pass into the **internal capsule**, which is *medially bordered by the [[Ventricular system#Lateral ventricles|Lateral ventricles]] and the [[Basal ganglia#Cuneate nucleus|Caudate nucleus]]*, and *laterally bordered by the [[Basal ganglia#Globus pallidus|Globus pallidus]]*.
- The axons eventually descend into the cerebral peduncles of the [[Midbrain]].

##### Subcortical gray matter
- Subcortical gray matter are also found, they are the [[Basal ganglia]].
##### Separation and connection of the two cerebral hemisphere
- The two cerebral hemisphere is separated by the **median longitudinal fissure**, which houses the [[Dural folds are present with the cranial meninges#Falx Cerebri|Falx cerebri]], and the **cingulate gyrus**.
- The two cerebral hemispheres are connected by the corpus collosum.
