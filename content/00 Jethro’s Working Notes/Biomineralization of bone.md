### Biomineralization of bone

Biomineralization of the bone matrix involves the addition of inorganic matrix to the organic matrix synthesized by [[Osteoblast]]s.

3 conditions are required for biomineralization of bone:

- ****************************************************************************************************************Increase in local ion concentration****************************************************************************************************************
    
    Increase in Ca2+ concentration:
    
    - Glycoproteins in organic matrix are present to regulate the biomineralization of bone:
        - Osteopontin - consist of stretches of aspartate residues
        - Osteocalcin - consist of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid
        - Bone sialoprotein - consist of stretches of glutamate residues
        
        The negatively charged glycoproteins attracts Ca2+, raising local Ca2+ concentration.
        
    
    Increase in PO4 3- concentration:
    
    - Alkaline phosphatase activity of [[Osteoblast]] results in formation of PO4 3-, raising local PO4 3- concentration.
- Decrease in mineralization inhibitors
- **********************Support for hydroxyapatite deposition**********************
    
    Collagen secreted by [[Osteoblast]]s assemble into fibrils, with hole zones, which facilitate nucleation, and supports Calcium hydroxyapatite deposition.

As one can see, [[Osteoblast]]s lies central to the secretion of organic matrix and the subsequent mineralization to form [[Bone matrix]].
