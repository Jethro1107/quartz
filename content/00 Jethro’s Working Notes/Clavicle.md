# Clavicle

The **clavicle**, part of the pectorial girdle is classified as a *long bone* (despite lacking a medullary region).
It is an S-shaped bone, where the medial two-thirds concaves anteriorly, and the lateral one thirds convexes anteriorly.

The superior surface is relatively smooth, whereas the inferior surface is marked by elevations and grooves:
- Medial (to the sternal end of the clavicle), the costal tubercle is present, the site of attachment of costoclavicular ligament, which stabilize the [[Sternoclavicular joint]].
- In the middle, the groove for [[Subclavius]] is present.
- Lateral (to the acromial end of the clavicle), the medial conoid process and lateral trapezoid line is present, for the attachment of coracoclavicular ligament, which stabilize the [[Acromioclavicular joint]].

- **Articulation of the clavicle**
	- The sternal end of the clavicle articulates with the manubrium of the sternum at the [[Sternoclavicular joint]]  - It forms the only bony attachment of the upper limb to the trunk.
	- The acromial end of the clavicle articulates with the acromion of the scapulae at the [[Acromioclavicular joint]].
