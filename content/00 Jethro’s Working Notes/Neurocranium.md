# Neurocranium
The neurocranium forms part of the [[Cranium]], which *encloses the cranial cavity*.
It consists of the **calvaria**, the dome-shaped roof of the cranial cavity, and the **cranial base**, the floor of the cranial cavity.
### Calvaria
The calvaria is the dome-shaped roof of the cranial cavity.
##### Bones of the calvaria
The calvaria is formed by the [[Frontal bone]] anteriorly, paired parietal bone laterally, and the Occipital bone posteriorly.
##### Features of the Calvaria
The the bones forming the calvaria is fused at various suctures:
- The [[Frontal bone]] fuses (or articulates with) the paired parietal bones at the **coronary suture**
- The paired parietal bones fuse at the **sagital suture**
- The paired parietal bone fuses with the occipital bone at the **lambdoid suture**
The point from which the coronary suture and sagital suture meet is the **Bregma**, and corresponds to the open **anterior fontanelle** in neonates, while the point from which the sagittal suture and lambdoid suture meet is the **Lambda**, and corresponds to the open **posterior fontanelle** in neonates.

In the parietal bone, parietal foramen is found near the sagittal suture, posteriorly, for the passage of **emissary veins**, responsible for the communication of scalp veins with the [[Dural venous sinus]].
### Cranial base
The cranial base forms the floor of the cranial cavity.
##### Bones of the cranial base
The cranial base is formed by the paired [[Temporal bone]] posterolaterally, and the unpaired [[Sphenoid bone]] anterolaterally.
The ethmoid bone forms a very small portion of the cranial base, and the primary part is considered part of the [[Viscerocranium]].
##### [[The cranial base is is separated into three cranial fossas]].
