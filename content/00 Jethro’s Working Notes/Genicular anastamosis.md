### Genicular anastamosis

Genicular anastamosis is an arterial anastamosis over the knee. It is contributed by the [[Femoral artery]], deep femoral artery, [[Popliteal artery]], [[Anterior tibial artery]] and  [[Posterior tibial artery]].

This creates collateral blood supply that maintains arterial supply to the leg and foot when the [[Popliteal artery]] is blocked.
