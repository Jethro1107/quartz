### Inguinal ligament

The inguinal ligament is an tendinous structure from the anterior superior iliac spine to the pubic tubercle.

- **Association with the external obliques**
    
    It serves as the inferior attachment of the external obliques, the most superficial layer of the three [[Flat muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall]].
    

It forms an opening with the superior ramus of the pubis ([[Gateways to the lower limb]]), which enables the passage of the femoral vein, artery and nerve (VAN) medially, and the psoas major and iliacus (muscles of the [[Posterior abdominal wall]]) laterally.
