### 4 phases of healing
There are essentially 4 sequential (yet, to a certain degree, overlapping) phases of healing, which are Hemostasis, Inflammation, Proliferation, and Remodelling.
- Hemostasis occurs within hours after an injury,
- Inflammation ([[IAS72  Acute inflammation ]]) starts within hours, after hemostasis is achieved, and lasts a maximum of 3 days.
- Proliferation follows, and lasts weeks.
- Remodelling follows and last for months.
