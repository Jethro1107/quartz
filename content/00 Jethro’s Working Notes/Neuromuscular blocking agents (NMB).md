# Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMB)
Neuromuscular blocking agents are a group of drugs used to inhibit [[Neurotransmission across a neuromuscular junction]] ([[Neuromuscular junction is highly specialised in terms of its physiological anatomy]]).

### Clinical use of NMB
Neuromuscular blocking agents are used in:
- Surgery as part of general anaesthesia
- [[Rapid sequence induction]] - As a laryngeal muscle relaxation to secure the airway in a short sequence of time
- Critical care - In ARDS (preventing patients from fighting ventilatory apparatus), In raised intracranial pressure (to sedate patient), In therapeutic hypothermia (to prevent shivering).
### Classification of NMB
- [[Depolarising NMB]]
- [[Non-depolarising NMB]]
### Safe monitoring of NMB
Safe monitoring of NMB is required to avoid prolonged paralysis and accidental awareness during general anaesthesia (AAGA).
- Prolonged paralysis is avoided by monitoring peripheral nerve stimulator.
- Accidental awareness is avoided by monitoring minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) for volantile anaesthesia, and Bispectral Index (BIS) for both IV and volantile anaesthesia.
