### Peritoneal cavity

The peritoneal cavity is a potential space (serous cavity) in the abdomen, enclosed by the [[Peritoneum]]. 

- **The peritoneal cavity is subdivided into:**
    
    The greater sac - The greater sac accounts for the larger space, accounting for most of the space in the peritoneal cavity. It begins superiorly at the diaphragm, and extends inferiorly into the pelvic cavity.
    
    The omental bursa/ lesser sac - The lesser sac is the space between the liver, the stomach and the [[Lesser omentum]] .
    
    The greater sac and lesser sac are continuous, at the omental foramen/ epiploic foramen/ foramen of Winslow, just posterior to the hepatoduodenal ligament.

Within the peritoneal cavity are the [[Mesenteries (Peritoneal [[folds)]]]] that connect organs to each other or to the abdominal wall.
