# Molecular machinery that mediates docking of synaptic vesicles to presynaptic membrane and membrane fushion
[[Chemical neurotransmission]] requires the the exocytosis of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft, which is mediated by key molecular machineries:
### For docking
Synaptobrevin on synaptic vesicles, syntaxin on presynaptic membrane and SNAP-25 coil around each other, docking the synaptic vesicles towards the presynaptic membrane.
### For membrane fusion
Normally, synaptotagmin on synaptic vesicles prevent close contact of vesicular membrane and presynaptic membrane, but upon Ca2+ influx, Ca2+-bound synaptotagmin catalyses membrane fushions, enabling exocytosis into the synaptic cleft.
