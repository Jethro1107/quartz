# Dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway
### Functions of the dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway
Dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway are *ascending pathways* involved in certain aspects of [[Somatosensation]], involved in detection of *two-point discriminatory touch, pressure, vibration, and proprioception*:
- These are detected by various mechanoreceptors such as Meckel's cell, Pacinian corpuscles, muscle spindles ([[Physiological anatomy of a skeletal muscle]]), and Golgi tendon organ ([[Golgi tendon reflex]]).
### Neuronal circuitry of dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway
1st order neuron (cell bodies within the dorsal root ganglia) receive signals from various mechanoreceptors from the skin, skeletal muscles, tendons and joints. 
The central axon of 1st order neuron ascend up the dorsal column, either in the medial **gracilate fasciculus** for lower limb 1st order neurons, or the lateral **cuneate fasciculate** for upper limb 1st order neuron.
Within the lower [[Medulla]], the axons of the 1st order nueron synapse with 2nd order neurons in the **nucleus gracilis** and **nucleus cuneatus**, where the axons of 2nd order neurons *decussate via the internal arcuate fibre of lower medulla*, causing axons to *ascend along the medial lamniscus contralaterally*.
2nd order neurons ascend along the medial lamniscus contralaterally, *ventrally in the medulla*, *dorsally and horizontally in the [[Pons]]* and *laterally in the [[Midbrain]]*.
Eventually, within the [[Thalamus]], axons of 2nd order neurons synapse with 3rd order neurons within the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus.
Axons of the 3rd order neurons project to the neurons of the **somatosensory cortex**.
