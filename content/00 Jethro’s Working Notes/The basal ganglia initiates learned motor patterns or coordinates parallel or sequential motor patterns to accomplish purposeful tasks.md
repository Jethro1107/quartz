# The basal ganglia initiates learned motor patterns or coordinates parallel or sequential motor patterns to accomplish purposeful tasks
The basal ganglia, part of the extrapyramidal system, does not directly execute movements, but is responsible for *initiating learned motor patterns*.
### The putamen circuitry initiates learned motor patterns
When the cerebral cortex, particularly the premotor cortex and supplementary motor areas ([[Motor cortex]]) generates the desire to move, it stimulates the [[Basal ganglia#Putamen|Putamen]], often bypassing the caudate nucleus.
The putamen (one can consider it as storing a learned motor pattern, similar to storage of a defined function in a python module), then stimulates the internal [[Basal ganglia#Globus pallidus|Globus pallidus]], which stimulates the ventrolateral nucleus of the [[Thalamus]].
The ventrolateral nucleus subsequently project to the primar motor cortex, portions of premotor cortex and SMA to execute the motor pattern.

### The caudate circuitry strings together several motor patterns
The C-shaped caudate nucleus receives signals from all association areas in the [[Cortex]] overlying the caudate nucleus, and integrates the different types of sensory and motor information.
It then signals the internal globus pallidus, which passes into the ventroanterior and ventrolateral nucleus of the [[Thalamus]], which then projects to the prefrontal, premotor and supplementary motor areas.
The premotor area and SMA puts together the learned motor patterns into a sequence of movements, then stimulate the primary motor cortex.
