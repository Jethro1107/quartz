### Cubital fossa

The cubital fossa is an important anatomical landmark that serves as the transition between the arm and the forearm. It lies anterior to the forearm.

- ********************************************************Borders of the cubital fossa********************************************************
    
    The cubital fossa is roughly a triangular depression:
    
    - Its lateral border is formed by the brachioradialis muscle
    - Its medial border is formed by the pronator teres
    - Its base is formed by an imaginary line between the medial and lateral epicondyle of the humerus.

Its floor is formed by the supinator and the [[Brachialis]].

Its roof is formed by the skin, fascia and bicepital aponeurosis.

- ********************************************************3 important structures are present in the cubital fossa********************************************************
    
    The tendons of [[Biceps brachii]] lies laterally, the [[Brachial artery]] is intermediate, and the [[Median nerve]] lies medially.
    
    The brachial artery tends to bifurcate at the apex of the cubital fossa, into the [[Radial artery]] and the [[Ulnar artery]].
    
    The median nerve leaves the cubital fossa between the two layers of the pronator teres.
