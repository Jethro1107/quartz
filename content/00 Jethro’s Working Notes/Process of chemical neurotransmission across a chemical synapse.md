# Process of chemical neurotransmission across a chemical synapse
Arrival of the [[Action potential]] at the presynaptic terminal results in opening of **L-type Ca 2+ channels**, resulting in Ca2+ influx.
Via various molecular machinery ([[Molecular machinery that mediates docking of synaptic vesicles to presynaptic membrane and membrane fushion]]), Ca2+ triggers the exocytosis of neurotransmitters in synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft.
Neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and binds to the receptor on postsynaptic terminal, resulting in a change in membrane potential, [[Excitatory post-synaptic potential and inhibitory post-synaptic potential results in a change in membrane excitability]].
