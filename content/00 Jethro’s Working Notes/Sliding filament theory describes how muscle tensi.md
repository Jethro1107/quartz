### Sliding filament theory describes how muscle tension is produced at a Sarcomere level

During cross bridge formation and power stroke of the [[Contractile cycle]], the area of the zone of overlap increases.

This pulls the 2 Z discs towards the M line, closer together, which results in decrease in sarcomere length. This results in increased muscle tension and muscle contraction.
