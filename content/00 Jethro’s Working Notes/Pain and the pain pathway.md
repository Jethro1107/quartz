# Pain and the pain pathway
### Definition of pain
Textbook definition: Pain is defined as an **unplesant sensation**, and **emotional experience** precipitated by **actual or potential tissue damage**.
How I refined the definition: Pain is regarded as a special [[Somatosensation]] mediated by *tissue damage* (any ailments of the body), that results in an *unplesant sensation*, and has significant *emotional component*.
### [[Fast pain and slow pain and their qualities]]
### Similar to other components of somatosensation, pain pathway is mediated at [[Somatosensation#Somatosensation is mediated at 3 levels|3 levels]]
##### Receptor level
Pain signals is detected by [[Nociceptors]].
##### Circuit Level
Similar to somatosensation, [[Somatosensory pathways are generally organised in a 3 neuron system]].
1st order neuron - [[Dual pathway for transmission of pain signals into the central nervous system underlies fast and slow pain]].
2nd order neuron:
- Lateral [[Spinothalamic pathway|Spinothalamic tract]] for *pain stimuli in the limb and trunks*
- [[Trigeminothalamic tract]] for *pain stimuli in the head and neck*
- But a very small portion of 2nd order neuron actually projects to the 3rd order neurons in the [[Thalamus#^006c17|Ventral posterior nucleus]] of the [[Thalamus]], which projects to the primary somatosensory complex for discriminative aspects of pain perception.
- Much of it project to the limbic system for affective aspects of pain, underlying the emotional components of pain.
##### Perceptual level
