### Osteoblast differentiation requires activation of RUNX2

During limb development, messenchymal cells condense to differentiate into osteochondroprogenitor cells, where further differentiation into [[Osteoblast]]s requires activation of RUNX2 gene (and other genes such as Osx gene), the master regulator for osteoblast differentiations.

RUNX2 regulates genes required for synthesis of [[Bone matrix]], that is required for osteoblastic activity during [[Endochondral ossification]].
