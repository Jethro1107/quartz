### Vitamin C is necessary for proline hydroxylation during collagen synthesis

Hydroxylation of proline residues of collagen chains enables formation of intramolecular H bonds, which promotes helical stability.

This is catalysed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase, which requires Fe2+ as a cofactor. Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid), keeps Fe2+ reduced as to maintain prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity.
