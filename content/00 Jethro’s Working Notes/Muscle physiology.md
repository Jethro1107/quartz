- Contraction of skeletal muscles
    - Molecular mechanism of sarcomere contraction
        - [[Sarcomere is the basic unit of a myofibril]]
        - [[Contractile cycle]]
        - [[Sliding filament theory describes how muscle tension is produced at a Sarcomere level]]
            - [[Initial sarcomere length determines muscle tension produced]]
    - [[Muscle hypertrophy and muscle atrophy]]
    - [[Different types of muscle fibres]]
    - [[Isotonic and isometric muscle contractions]]
- The neuromuscular junction
    - [[Neuromuscular junction is highly specialised in terms of its physiological anatomy]].
    - [[Neurotransmission across a neuromuscular junction]], followed by generation of muscle action potential, and then excitation-contraction coupling, followed by the contractile cycle.
    - [[Motor unit]]
        - [[Muscle tension is dependent on motor unit recruitment]]
            - Spatial recruitment
            - Temporal recruitment - [[Twitch, summation and tetanus]]
    - One of the most common NMJ disorder - [[Myasthesia gravis]]
