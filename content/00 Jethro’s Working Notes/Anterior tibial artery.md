# Anterior tibial artery
The anterior tibial artery is a branch of the [[Popliteal artery]] as it crosses the inferior border of the popliteus.

### In the leg
It accesses the anterior compartment of the leg superior to the interosseus membrane, and descends along the anterior compartment of the leg, deep to the extensor digitorum longus, similar to the [[Common peroneal nerve (Common fibular nerve)#^9254d5|Deep fibular nerve]].
### In the ankle and foot
As it crosses the ankle joint, it is renamed as the *dorsalis pedis artery,* which courses lateral to the extensor haullicus longus tendon and gives the arcuate artery.
