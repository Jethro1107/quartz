### Histology of the liver

The liver is the largest gland in the body.

- **The liver consist of an overarching histological architecture, that is:**
    
    The Glissonâ€™s capsule surrounds the entire liver. The capsule forms connective tissue stroma that extends into the liver to separate the parenchyma into lobules.
    
    The connective tissue stroma consists of blood vessels, bile ducts, lymphatics and nerves.
