# Brain circulation
The cerebral circulation describes the arterial supply and venous drainage of the cerebrum.

### Arterial supply of the brain
The brain, collectively is supplied by 4 arteries: 2 **internal carotid arteries** and 2 **vertebral arteries**. 
The 4 arteries pierce through the dura mater and lie in the [[Meninges#Arachnoid mater and the subarachnoid space|Subarachnoid space]].
##### Internal carotid arteries
Internal carotid arteries is the internal branch of the common carotid artery at the carotid sinus. 
It ascends the neck and passes through the **carotid canal** of the **Temporal bone**, then courses horizontally through the [[Carveneous sinus]] and pierces through the dura mater into the subarachnoid space. It then courses posteriorly, until it reaches the medial end of the lateral sulcus. Here, it gives its terminal branches.
###### Branches of the internal carotid arteries provide anterior circulation of the cerebrum
- **Anterior cerebral arteries**
	- The anterior cerebral arteries run in the interhemispheric fissure and courses along the **corpus collosum** (and may anastamose with the posterior cerebral artery, giving off brain perforators that supply the anterior and superior surfaces of the cerebrum medially.
	- The two anterior cerebral arteries are connected by the anterior communicated artery, completing the [[Circle of Willis]].
- **Middle cerebral arteries**
	- The middle cerebral artery courses along the lateral sulcus between the frontal lobe and the temporal lobe.
	- Along its course, the middle cerebral artery gives deep branches/brain perforators (e.g. Lenticostriate arteries) that supplies deep structures of the brain.
	- As it emerges  from the lateral sulcus, it gives superficial branches that supply the lateral surface of the cerebrum.
- **Opthalmic artery**
- **Posterior communicating artery**
##### Verterbal arteries
Vertebral arteries are branches of the subclavian artery that ascend through the [[Features of cervical vertebrae#^c633cc|Transverse foramen]] of C6 to C1.
It then courses posterior to the lateral masses of the atlas (C1), and ascends through the foramen magnum of the skull, and pierces through the dura mater into the subarachnoid space, then passes up the [[Medulla]].
The two vertebral arteries join at the pons to give the **basillar artery**, collectively known as the **vertebrobasillar complex**. ^20aa22

###### Branches of the vertebrobasillar complex and its supply
- Vertebral arteries branch to give - anterior spinal artery, and posterior inferior cerebellar artery
- Basillar arteries branch to give pontine arteries and other brain perforators, superior cerebellar artery, and middle cerebellar artery. ^b6a2a0
- [[Branches of the vertebrobasilar complex provides arterial supply to the cerebellum]].
- **Bacillary artery bifurcates terminally into the two posterior cerebral artery** ^488baa
	- The bacillary artery bifurcates terminally into the two posterior cerebral artery, which communicate with the posterior communicating arteries (branch of internal carotid artery). ^839396
	- The posterior cerebral artery wraps laterally around the [[Midbrain]] and supplies the posterior area of cerebrum, more specifically, the inferolateral and medial surface of the **temporal lobe** and the lateral and medial surface of the **occipital lobe**.

### Venous drainage of the cerebrum
Superficial and deep cerebral veins drain venous blood from the cerebrum, into the [[Dural venous sinus]]. They serve as bridging veins of dural venous sinuses.

Superficial veins: Superior cerebral veins, superficial middle cerebral veins, and inferior cerebral vein
deep cerebral veins: Basal vein, great vein of Galen

Note that superficial cerebral veins drain into the [[Dural venous sinus#Superior sagital sinus|Superior sagittal sinus]], while deep cerebral veins drain into [[Dural venous sinus#Straight sinus|Straight sinus]], where both subsequently drains into the confluence of sinuses and into the transverse-sigmoid sinus, eventually into internal jugular vein..
