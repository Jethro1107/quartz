# Femoral artery
The femoral artery is the continuation of the external iliac artery as it emerges from the mid-inguinal point into the thigh.

### In the thigh
The femoral artery is found in the [[Femoral triangle]], and forms the lateral border of the [[Femoral sheath]].
- **In the thigh, the femoral artery gives off an immediate branch called the deep femoral artery.**
	The deep femoral artery gives rise to the medial and lateral circumflex femoral artery which anastamose at the femoral neck, and 4 perforating arteries.
	Particularly, the circumflex femoral artery and 1st perforating branch of deep profundus artery partakes in the [[Hip joint anastamosis]].
It leaves the femoral triangle by passing through a muscular space, the [[Adductor canal]].
It then leaves the adductor canal through the adductor hiatus, between the insertion of the 2 portions of the adductor magnus muscle, emerging posteriorly.
