### Several mechanisms prevent autodigestion of the pancreas

[[Pancreatitis]] is caused by the autodigestion of the pancreas due to the inappropriate release and activation of pancreatic enzymes. In normal circumstances, there are several factors that protect the pancreas from autodigestion:

1. Much of the pancreatic enzymes are synthesized in forms of inactive enzymes ([[The pancreas release a list of zymogens for protein digestion]]), which are only activated by trypsin, whereas trypsin is activated by enterokinase on jejunal brush borders, i.e. *Much of pancreatic enzymes remains inactive until they are released into the small intestines.*
2. *Pancreatic acinar cells, along with the release of proteolytic enzymes, also release trypsin inhibitors.* Trypsin inhibitors inhibit the activation of trypsinogen into trypsin. As trypsin activates the remaining zymogens, trypsin inhibitors indirectly inhibit the activation of the other proteolytic enzymes as well.
