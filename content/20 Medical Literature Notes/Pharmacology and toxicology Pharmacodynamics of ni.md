# Pharmacology and toxicology: Pharmacodynamics of nitrates

Created time: April 11, 2022 3:47 PM

### Summary

A primary direct result of an effective dose of [nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) is marked relaxation of veins with increased venous capacitance and decreased ventricular preload. Pulmonary vascular pressures and heart size are significantly reduced. In the absence of heart failure, cardiac output is reduced. Because venous capacitance is increased, orthostatic hypotension may be marked and syncope can result. Dilation of large epicardial coronary arteries may improve [oxygen](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=131723) delivery in the presence of eccentric atheromas or collateral vessels. Temporal artery pulsations and a throbbing headache associated with meningeal artery pulsations are common effects of [nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) and amyl nitrite. In heart failure, preload is often abnormally high; the nitrates and other vasodilators, by reducing preload, may have a beneficial effect on cardiac output in this condition (see [Chapter 13](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?legacysectionid=Katz15_ch13)).

Main mechanism is by increasing venous capacitance and reducing preload

Adverse effects of orthostatic hypotension and headaches is caused by the increased venous capacitance and thus decrease in blood pressure

****Pharmacodynamics****

**A. Mechanism of Action in Smooth Muscle**

After more than a century of study, the mechanism of action of [nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) is still not fully understood. There is general agreement that the drug must be bioactivated with the release of **nitric oxide.** Unlike [nitroprusside](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426817) and some other direct nitric oxide donors, [nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) activation requires enzymatic action. [Nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) can be denitrated by glutathione *S*-transferase in smooth muscle and other cells. A mitochondrial enzyme, aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 2 (ALDH2) and possibly isoform 3 (ALDH3), appears to be key in the activation and release of nitric oxide from [nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate. Different enzymes may be involved in the denitration of isosorbide dinitrate and mononitrate. Free nitrite ion is released, which is then converted to nitric oxide (see [Chapter 19](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?legacysectionid=Katz15_ch19)). Nitric oxide (probably complexed with [cysteine](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=424918)) combines with the heme group of soluble guanylyl cyclase, activating that enzyme and causing an increase in cGMP. As shown in [Figure 12–2](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?bookid=2988&sectionid=250595578#katz15_ch12fg2), formation of cGMP represents a first step toward smooth muscle relaxation. The production of prostaglandin E or prostacyclin (PGI2) and membrane hyperpolarization may also be involved. There is no evidence that autonomic receptors are involved in the primary nitrate response. However, autonomic *reflex* responses, evoked when hypotensive doses are given, are common. As described in the following text, tolerance is an important consideration in the use of nitrates. Although tolerance may be caused in part by a decrease in tissue sulfhydryl groups, eg, on [cysteine](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=424918), tolerance can be only partially prevented or reversed with a sulfhydryl-regenerating agent. Increased generation of oxygen-free radicals during nitrate therapy may be another important mechanism of tolerance. Recent evidence suggests that diminished availability of [calcitonin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426504) gene-related peptide (CGRP, a potent vasodilator) is also associated with nitrate tolerance.

**Nicorandil** and several other antianginal agents not available in the United States appear to combine the activity of nitric oxide release with a direct potassium channel-opening action, thus providing an additional mechanism for causing vasodilation.

**B. Organ System Effects**

[Nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) relaxes all types of smooth muscle regardless of the cause of the preexisting muscle tone ([Figure 12–3](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?bookid=2988&sectionid=250595578#katz15_ch12fg3)). It has practically no direct effect on cardiac or skeletal muscle.

**1. VASCULAR SMOOTH MUSCLE**

All segments of the vascular system from large arteries through large veins relax in response to [nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816). Most evidence suggests a gradient of response, with veins responding at the lowest concentrations and arteries at slightly higher ones. The epicardial coronary arteries are sensitive, but concentric atheromas can prevent significant dilation. On the other hand, eccentric lesions permit an increase in flow when nitrates relax the smooth muscle on the side away from the lesion. Arterioles and precapillary sphincters are dilated least, partly because of reflex responses and partly because different vessels vary in their ability to release nitric oxide from the drug.

A primary direct result of an effective dose of [nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) is marked relaxation of veins with increased venous capacitance and decreased ventricular preload. Pulmonary vascular pressures and heart size are significantly reduced. In the absence of heart failure, cardiac output is reduced. Because venous capacitance is increased, orthostatic hypotension may be marked and syncope can result. Dilation of large epicardial coronary arteries may improve [oxygen](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=131723) delivery in the presence of eccentric atheromas or collateral vessels. Temporal artery pulsations and a throbbing headache associated with meningeal artery pulsations are common effects of [nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) and amyl nitrite. In heart failure, preload is often abnormally high; the nitrates and other vasodilators, by reducing preload, may have a beneficial effect on cardiac output in this condition (see [Chapter 13](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?legacysectionid=Katz15_ch13)).

The indirect effects of [nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) consist of those compensatory responses evoked by baroreceptors and hormonal mechanisms responding to decreased arterial pressure (see [Figure 6–7](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/katz15_ch6fg7)); this often results in tachycardia and increased cardiac contractility. Retention of salt and water may also be significant, especially with intermediate- and long-acting nitrates. These compensatory responses contribute to the development of nitrate tolerance.

In normal subjects without coronary disease, [nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) can induce a significant, if transient, increase in total coronary blood flow. In contrast, there is no evidence that total coronary flow is increased in patients with angina due to atherosclerotic obstructive coronary artery disease. However, some studies suggest that *redistribution* of coronary flow from normal to ischemic regions may play a role in [nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816)’s therapeutic effect. [Nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) also exerts a weak negative inotropic effect on the heart via nitric oxide.

**2. OTHER SMOOTH MUSCLE ORGANS**

Relaxation of smooth muscle of the bronchi, gastrointestinal tract (including biliary system), and genitourinary tract has been demonstrated experimentally. Because of their brief duration, these actions of the nitrates are rarely of any clinical value. During recent decades, the use of amyl nitrite and isobutyl nitrite (not nitrates) by inhalation as recreational (sex-enhancing) drugs has become popular with some people. Nitrites readily release nitric oxide in erectile tissue as well as vascular smooth muscle and activate guanylyl cyclase. The resulting increase in cGMP causes dephosphorylation of myosin light chains and relaxation ([Figure 12–2](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?bookid=2988&sectionid=250595578#katz15_ch12fg2)), which enhances erection. This pharmacologic approach to erectile dysfunction is discussed in the Box: [Drugs Used in the Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?bookid=2988&sectionid=250595578#katz15_ch12_bx1-1).

**3. ACTION ON PLATELETS**

Nitric oxide released from [nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) stimulates guanylyl cyclase in platelets as in smooth muscle. The increase in cGMP that results is responsible for a decrease in platelet aggregation. Unfortunately, recent prospective trials have established no survival benefit when [nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) is used in acute myocardial infarction. In contrast, intravenous [nitroglycerin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426816) may be of value in unstable angina, in part through its action on platelets.

**4. OTHER EFFECTS**

**Nitrite** ion (not nitrate ion) reacts with hemoglobin (which contains ferrous iron) to produce methemoglobin (by oxidation of ferrous to ferric iron). Because methemoglobin has a very low affinity for [oxygen](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=131723), large doses of nitrites can result in pseudocyanosis, tissue hypoxia, and death. Fortunately, the plasma concentration of nitrite resulting from even large doses of organic and inorganic nitrates is too low to cause significant methemoglobinemia in adults. In nursing infants, the intestinal flora is capable of converting significant amounts of inorganic nitrate (sometimes present, eg, in well water) to nitrite ion. In addition, sodium nitrite is used as a curing agent for meats, eg, corned beef. Thus, inadvertent exposure to large amounts of nitrite ion can occur and may produce serious toxicity.

One therapeutic application of this otherwise toxic effect of nitrite has been discovered. Cyanide poisoning results from complexing and inactivation of cytochrome iron by the CN− ion. Methemoglobin iron has a very high affinity for CN−; thus, administration of sodium nitrite (NaNO2) soon after cyanide exposure regenerates active cytochrome. The cyanomethemoglobin produced can be further detoxified by the intravenous administration of sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3); this results in formation of thiocyanate ion (SCN−), a less toxic ion that is readily excreted. Methemoglobinemia, if excessive, can be treated by giving methylene blue intravenously. This antidote for cyanide poisoning (inhaled amyl nitrite plus intravenous sodium nitrite, followed by intravenous sodium thiocyanate and, if needed, methylene blue) is now being replaced by [hydroxocobalamin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=425033), a form of vitamin B12, which also has a very high affinity for cyanide ion and combines with it to generate [cyanocobalamin](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426555), another form of vitamin B12, and free cytochrome.
