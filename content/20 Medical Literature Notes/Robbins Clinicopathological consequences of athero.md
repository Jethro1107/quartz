## Consequences of Atherosclerotic Disease

**Myocardial infarction (heart attack), cerebral infarction (stroke), aortic aneurysms, and peripheral vascular disease (gangrene of the legs) are the major consequences of atherosclerosis.** Large elastic arteries (e.g., aorta, carotid, and iliac arteries) and large- and medium-sized muscular arteries (e.g., coronary and popliteal arteries) are the major targets of atherosclerosis. Symptomatic atherosclerotic disease most often involves the arteries supplying the heart, brain, kidneys, and lower extremities. The natural history, principal morphologic features, and main pathogenic events are schematized in [Fig. 11.17](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0090) .

Atherosclerotic plaque formation, activities, and outcomes. In a lesion-prone area along with other risk factors, a reversible fatty streak is formed, which can progress to atherosclerosis. Compensatory enlargement initially prevents a reduction of blood flow through the vessel. A plaque can become a thin cap plaque (unstable, vulnerable), a thick cap plaque (stable), or a fibrotic plaque (stable). Thin cap plaques are the most prone to plaque rupture, generally leading to sudden cardiac death. Stable plaques can undergo surface erosion and thrombosis, rapidly expanding the plaque size and leading to more prominent calcifications. This event can lead to sudden cardiac death. Extensive narrowing of the luminal diameter from large plaques generally results in critical stenosis, reducing blood supply to the heart and resulting in angina.

We next describe the features of atherosclerotic lesions that are typically responsible for the clinicopathologic manifestations.

### Atherosclerotic Stenosis

In small arteries, atherosclerotic plaques can gradually occlude vessel lumens, compromising blood flow and causing ischemic injury. At early stages of stenosis, outward remodeling of the vessel media tends to preserve the size of the lumen. However, there are limits on the extent of remodeling, and eventually the expanding atheroma impinges on the lumen to such a degree that blood flow is compromised (see [Fig. 11.17](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0090) ). *Critical stenosis* is the stage at which the occlusion is sufficiently severe to cause tissue ischemia. In the coronary (and other) circulations, this typically occurs when the occlusion produces a 70% to 75% decrease in luminal cross-sectional area; with this degree of stenosis, chest pain may develop with exertion (so-called *stable angina* ; see [Chapter 12](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323531139000121?scrollTo=%23c00012) ). Although acute plaque rupture (see later) is the most dangerous consequence, atherosclerosis also takes a toll through chronically diminished arterial perfusion. Mesenteric occlusion and bowel ischemia, sudden cardiac death, chronic ischemic heart disease, ischemic encephalopathy, and intermittent claudication (diminished perfusion of the extremities) all are consequences of flow-limiting stenoses. The effects of vascular occlusion ultimately depend on arterial supply and the metabolic demand of the affected tissue. If stenosis occurs slowly, smaller adjacent vessels can partially compensate by enlarging and creating collateral circulation to perfuse the organ.

### Acute Plaque Change

Plaque erosion or rupture is typically promptly followed by partial or complete vascular thrombosis (see [Fig. 11.16](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0085) ), resulting in acute tissue infarction (e.g., myocardial or cerebral infarction) (see [Fig. 11.17](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0090) ). Plaque changes fall into three general categories:

- *Rupture/fissuring,* exposing highly thrombogenic plaque constituents that activate coagulation and induce thrombosis that is often completely occlusive
- *Erosion/ulceration,* exposing the thrombogenic subendothelial basement membrane to blood, less-frequently inducing fully occlusive thrombosis
