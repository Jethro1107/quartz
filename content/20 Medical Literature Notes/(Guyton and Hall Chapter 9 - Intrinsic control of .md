# Intrinsic control of the heart pumping - the Frank-Starling mechanism

In [Chapter 20](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000205) , we will learn that under most conditions, the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute is normally determined almost entirely by the rate of blood flow into the heart from the veins, which is called *venous return.* That is, each peripheral tissue of the body controls its own local blood flow, and all the local tissue flows combine and return by way of the veins to the right atrium. The heart, in turn, automatically pumps this incoming blood into the arteries so that it can flow around the circuit again.

This intrinsic ability of the heart to adapt to increasing volumes of inflowing blood is called the *Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart,* named in honor of Otto Frank and Ernest Starling, two great physiologists. Basically, the Frank-Starling mechanism means that the more the heart muscle is stretched during filling, the greater is the force of contraction, and the greater is the quantity of blood pumped into the aorta. Or, stated another way— *within physiological limits, the heart pumps all the blood that returns to it by way of the veins.*

## What Is the Explanation of the Frank-Starling Mechanism?

When an extra amount of blood flows into the ventricles, the cardiac muscle is stretched to a greater length. This stretching causes the muscle to contract with increased force because the actin and myosin filaments are brought to a more nearly optimal degree of overlap for force generation. Therefore, the ventricle, because of its increased pumping, automatically pumps the extra blood into the arteries. This ability of stretched muscle, up to an optimal length, to contract with increased work output is characteristic of all striated muscle, as explained in [Chapter 6](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000060) , and is not simply a characteristic of cardiac muscle.

In addition to the important effect of lengthening the heart muscle, another factor increases heart pumping when its volume is increased. Stretch of the right atrial wall directly increases the heart rate by 10% to 20%, which also helps increase the amount of blood pumped each minute, although its contribution is much less than that of the Frank-Starling mechanism. As discussed in [Chapter 18](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000187) , stretch of the atrium also activates stretch receptors and a nervous reflex, the *Bainbridge reflex* , that is transmitted by the vagus nerve and may increase heart rate an additional 40% to 60%.

## Ventricular Function Curves

One of the best ways to express the functional ability of the ventricles to pump blood is by *ventricular function curves.* **[Figure 9-12](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0065)** shows a type of ventricular function curve called the *stroke work output curve.* Note that as atrial pressure for each side of the heart increases, stroke work output for that side increases until it reaches the limit of the ventricle’s pumping ability.

**[Figure 9-13](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0070)** shows another type of ventricular function curve called the *ventricular volume output curve.* The two curves of this figure represent function of the two ventricles of the human heart based on data extrapolated from experimental animal studies. As the right and left atrial pressures increase, the respective ventricular volume outputs per minute also increase.

Thus, *ventricular function curves* are another way of expressing the Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart. That is, as the ventricles fill in response to higher atrial pressures, each ventricular volume and strength of cardiac muscle contraction increase, causing the heart to pump increased quantities of blood into the arteries.
