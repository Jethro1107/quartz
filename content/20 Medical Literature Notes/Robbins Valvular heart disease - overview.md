## Valvular Heart Disease

Valvular disease can come to clinical attention due to stenosis, insufficiency (synonyms: regurgitation or incompetence), or both.

- *Stenosis*  is the failure of a valve to open completely, obstructing forward flow. Acquired valvular stenosis is almost always due to a primary leaflet abnormality and is virtually always a chronic process (e.g., calcification or valve scarring).
- *Insufficiency*  results from failure of a valve to close completely, thereby allowing regurgitation (backflow) of blood. Valvular insufficiency can result from either intrinsic disease of the valve leaflets (e.g., endocarditis) or disruption of the supporting structures (e.g., the aorta, mitral annulus, tendinous cords, papillary muscles, or ventricular free wall) without primary leaflet injury. It can appear abruptly, as with chordal rupture, or insidiously as a consequence of leaflet scarring and retraction.

Stenosis or insufficiency can occur alone or together in the same valve. Valvular disease can involve only one valve (the mitral valve being the most common target) or more than one valve. Abnormal flow through diseased valves typically produces abnormal heart sounds called murmurs; severe lesions can even be externally palpated as thrills  *.*Depending on the valve involved, murmurs are best heard at different locations on the chest wall; moreover, the nature (regurgitation versus stenosis) and severity of the valvular disease determines the quality and timing of the murmur (e.g., harsh systolic or soft diastolic murmurs).

The clinical consequences of valve dysfunction vary depending on the valve involved, the degree of impairment, the tempo of disease onset, and the rate and quality of compensatory mechanisms. For example, sudden destruction of an aortic valve cusp by infection (infectious endocarditis; see later) can cause acute, massive, and rapidly fatal aortic regurgitation. In contrast, rheumatic mitral stenosis typically develops indolently over years, and its clinical effects can be well tolerated for extended periods. Certain conditions can complicate valvular heart disease by increasing the demands on the heart; for example, the increased output demands of pregnancy can exacerbate valve disease and lead to unfavorable maternal or fetal outcomes. Valvular stenosis or insufficiency often produces secondary changes, both proximal and distal to the affected valve, particularly in the myocardium. Generally, valvular stenosis leads to pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy, whereas valvular insufficiency leads to volume overload; both situations can culminate in heart failure. In addition, the ejection of blood through narrowed stenotic valves can produce high speed “jets” of blood that injure the endothelium or endocardium where they impact.

Valvular abnormalities can be congenital (discussed earlier) or acquired. Acquired valvular stenosis is almost always a consequence of a remote or chronic injury of the valve leaflets that declares itself clinically only after many years. In contrast, acquired valvular insufficiency can result from intrinsic disease of the valve leaflets or damage to or distortion of the supporting structures (e.g., the aorta, mitral annulus, tendinous cords, papillary muscles, ventricular free wall).

The causes of acquired heart valve diseases are summarized in  [Table 12.8](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/t0045) . The most frequent causes of the major valvular lesions are as follows:

- *Aortic stenosis:*  calcification and sclerosis of anatomically normal or congenitally bicuspid aortic valves
- *Aortic insufficiency:*  dilation of the ascending aorta, often secondary to hypertension and/or aging
- *Mitral stenosis:*  rheumatic heart disease (RHD)
- *Mitral insufficiency:*  myxomatous degeneration (MVP), or left ventricular dilation due to ischemic or nonischemic heart failure
