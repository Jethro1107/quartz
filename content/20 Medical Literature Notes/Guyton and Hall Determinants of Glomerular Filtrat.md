## Increased Glomerular Capillary Filtration Coefficient Increases Glomerular Filtrate Rate

The K f is a measure of the product of the hydraulic conductivity and surface area of the glomerular capillaries. The K f cannot be measured directly, but can be is estimated experimentally by dividing the GFR by the net filtration pressure:

Kf=GFR/Net filtration pressure

Because the total GFR for both kidneys is about 125 ml/min, and the net filtration pressure is 10 mm Hg, the normal K f is calculated to be about 12.5 ml/min per mm Hg of filtration pressure. When K f is expressed per 100 grams of kidney weight, it averages about 4.2 ml/min per mm Hg, a value about 400 times as high as the K f of most other capillary systems of the body. The average K f of many other tissues in the body is only about 0.01 ml/min per mm Hg/100 g. This high K f for the glomerular capillaries contributes to their rapid rate of fluid filtration.

Although increased K f raises the GFR and decreased K f reduces the GFR, changes in K f probably do not provide a primary mechanism for the normal daily regulation of GFR. Some diseases, however, lower K f by reducing the number of functional glomerular capillaries (thereby reducing the surface area for filtration) or by increasing the thickness of the glomerular capillary membrane and reducing its hydraulic conductivity. For example, chronic uncontrolled hypertension may gradually reduce K f by increasing the thickness of the glomerular capillary basement membrane and, eventually, by damaging the capillaries so severely that there is loss of capillary function.

## Increased Glomerular Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure Increases Glomerular Filtration Rate

The glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure has been estimated to be about 60 mm Hg under normal conditions. Changes in glomerular hydrostatic pressure serve as the primary means for physiological regulation of GFR. Increases in glomerular hydrostatic pressure raise the GFR, whereas decreases in glomerular hydrostatic pressure reduce the GFR.

Glomerular hydrostatic pressure is determined by three variables, each of which is under physiological control: (1) *arterial pressure* ; (2) *afferent arteriolar resistance* ; and (3) *efferent arteriolar resistance* .

Increased arterial pressure tends to raise glomerular hydrostatic pressure and, therefore, to increase the GFR. However, as discussed later, this effect is buffered by autoregulatory mechanisms that maintain a relatively constant glomerular pressure as arterial pressure fluctuates.

Increased resistance of afferent arterioles reduces glomerular hydrostatic pressure and decreases the GFR ( [Figure 27-6](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0035) ). Conversely, dilation of the afferent arterioles increases glomerular hydrostatic pressure and GFR.

Constriction of the efferent arterioles increases the resistance to outflow from the glomerular capillaries. This mechanism raises glomerular hydrostatic pressure and, as long as the increase in efferent resistance does not reduce renal blood flow too much, GFR increases slightly (see [Figure 27-6](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0035) ). However, because efferent arteriolar constriction also reduces renal blood flow, filtration fraction and glomerular colloid osmotic pressure increase as efferent arteriolar resistance increases. Therefore, if constriction of efferent arterioles is severe (more than about a threefold increase in efferent arteriolar resistance), the rise in colloid osmotic pressure exceeds the increase in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure caused by efferent arteriolar constriction. When this situation occurs, the *net force* for filtration actually decreases, causing a reduction in GFR.
Thus, efferent arteriolar constriction has a biphasic effect on GFR ( [Figure 27-7](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0040) ). At moderate levels of constriction, there is a slight increase in GFR but, with severe constriction, there is a decrease in GFR. The primary cause of the eventual decrease in GFR is as follows. As efferent constriction becomes severe, and as plasma protein concentration increases, there is a rapid nonlinear increase in colloid osmotic pressure caused by the Donnan effect; the higher the protein concentration, the more rapidly the colloid osmotic pressure rises because of the interaction of ions bound to the plasma proteins, which also exert an osmotic effect, as discussed in [Chapter 16](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000163) .

To summarize, constriction of afferent arterioles reduces GFR. However, the effect of efferent arteriolar constriction depends on the severity of the constriction; modest efferent constriction raises GFR, but severe efferent constriction (more than a threefold increase in resistance) tends to reduce GFR.
