    During metabolism, the body produces several acids that increase the hydro-
    gen ion concentration of the blood or other body fluids and tend to lower the
    pH (Table 4.2). These metabolically important acids can be classified as weak
    acids or strong acids by their degree of dissociation into a hydrogen ion and a
    base (the anion component). Inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and
    hydrochloric acid (HCl) are strong acids that dissociate completely in solution
    (Fig. 4.6). Organic acids containing carboxylic acid groups (e.g., the ketone bod-
    ies acetoacetic acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid) are weak acids that dissociate to
    only a limited extent in water. In general, a weak acid (HA), called the *conjugate
    acid*, dissociates into a hydrogen ion and an anionic component (A-), called the
    
    *conjugate base*. The name of an undissociated acid usually ends in “-ic acid”
    (e.g., acetoacetic acid), and the name of the dissociated anionic component ends
    in “-ate” (e.g., acetoacetate).
    
    The tendency of the acid (HA) to dissociate and donate a hydrogen ion to
    solution is denoted by its *K*a, the equilibrium constant for dissociation of a weak
    acid (Equation 4.4). The higher the *K*a, the greater is the tendency to dissociate a
    proton.
    
    **Equation 4.4. The Ka of an acid.**
    HA↔A- + H+
    
    Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA]
    
    In the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the formula for the dissociation constant
    of a weak acid is converted to a convenient logarithmic equation (Equation 4.5).
    The term p*K*a represents the negative log of *K*a. If the p*K*a for a weak acid is known,
    this equation can be used to calculate the ratio of the unprotonated to the protonated
    form at any pH. From this equation, you can see that a weak acid is 50% dissociated
    at a pH equal to its p*K*a.
    
    **Equation 4.5. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.**
    
    For the weak acid HA,
    
    pH = pKa + log[A-]/[HA]
    
    Most of the metabolic carboxylic acids have a p*K*a between 2 and 5, depending
    on the other groups on the molecule (see Table 4.2). The p*K*a reflects the strength of
    an acid. Acids with a p*K*a of 2 are stronger acids than those with a p*K*a of 5 because,
    at any pH, a greater proportion is dissociated.
