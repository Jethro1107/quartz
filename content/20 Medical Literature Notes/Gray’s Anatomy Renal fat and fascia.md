## Renal fat and fascia

The kidneys are enclosed in and associated with a unique arrangement of fascia and fat. Immediately outside the renal capsule, there is an accumulation of extraperitoneal fat—the  **perinephric fat** ( **perirenal fat** ), which completely surrounds the kidney (  [Fig. 4.152](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0705) ). Enclosing the perinephric fat is a membranous condensation of the extraperitoneal fascia (the  **renal fascia** ). The suprarenal glands are also enclosed in this fascial compartment, usually separated from the kidneys by a thin septum. The renal fascia must be incised in any surgical approach to this organ.

At the lateral margins of each kidney, the anterior and posterior layers of the renal fascia fuse (  [Fig. 4.152](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0705) ). This fused layer may connect with the transversalis fascia on the lateral abdominal wall.

Above each suprarenal gland, the anterior and posterior layers of the renal fascia fuse and blend with the fascia that covers the diaphragm.

Medially, the anterior layer of the renal fascia continues over the vessels in the hilum and fuses with the connective tissue associated with the abdominal aorta and the inferior vena cava (  [Fig. 4.152](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0705) ). In some cases, the anterior layer may cross the midline to the opposite side and blend with its companion layer.

The posterior layer of the renal fascia passes medially between the kidney and the fascia covering the quadratus lumborum muscle to fuse with the fascia covering the psoas major muscle.

Inferiorly, the anterior and posterior layers of the renal fascia enclose the ureters.

In addition to perinephric fat and the renal fascia, a final layer of  **paranephric fat (pararenal fat)**completes the fat and fascias associated with the kidney (  [Fig. 4.152](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0705) ). This fat accumulates posterior and posterolateral to each kidney.
