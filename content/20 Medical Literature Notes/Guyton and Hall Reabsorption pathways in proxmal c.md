# Guyton and Hall: Reabsorption pathways in proxmal convoluted tubules

## Solutes Can Be Transported Through Epithelial Cells or Between Cells

Renal tubular cells, like other epithelial cells, are held together by *tight junctions* . Lateral intercellular spaces lie behind the tight junctions and separate the epithelial cells of the tubule. Solutes can be reabsorbed or secreted across the cells through the *transcellular pathway* or between the cells by moving across the tight junctions and intercellular spaces via the *paracellular pathway* . Sodium is a substance that moves through both routes, although most of the sodium is transported through the transcellular pathway. In some nephron segments, especially the proximal tubule, water is also reabsorbed across the paracellular pathway, and substances dissolved in the water, especially potassium, magnesium, and chloride ions, are carried with the reabsorbed fluid between the cells.
