Created time: April 16, 2022 4:18 PM

Rank the following **receptors** for **affinity to dobutamine**, from highest to lowest: β1, β2, α

{{c1::β1 > β2 > α}}

What effect does **dobutamine** have on **HR** and **contractility**?

{{c1::Increased HR/contractility (β1 agonist)}}

**Dobutamine** causes *mild* **vaso-{{c1::dilation}}** *due to β2 activity, mild b/c it's vasodilatory effects are reduced by Dobutamine's alpha agonist ability*

**Dobutamine** causes increased pulse pressure, with increased systolic pressure *via β1-mediated increased cardiac output* and decreased diastolic pressure *via β2-mediated arteriolar dilation*
