Equation derived from [[CPR07  Ventilation - alveolar gas equation]]

The factors that determine the precise value of alveolar *P*O2 are (1) the *P*O2 of atmospheric air, (2) the rate of alveolar ventilation, and (3) the rate of total-body oxygen consump- tion. Although equations exist for calculating the alveolar gas pressures from these variables, we will describe the interactions in a qualitative manner (**Table 13–6**). To start, we will assume that only one of the factors changes at a time.

First, a decrease in the *P*O2 of the inspired air, such as would occur at high altitude, will decrease alveolar *P*O2.

A decrease in alveolar ventilation will decrease the alveolar PO2 because less fresh air is entering the alveoli per unit time.

Finally, an increase in the oxygen consumption in the cells (V dot O2) will also lower alveolar *P*O2 because a larger fraction of the oxygen in the entering fresh air will leave the alveoli to enter the blood for use by the tissues. (Recall that in the steady state, the volume of oxygen entering the blood in the lungs per unit time is always equal to the volume utilized by the tissues.)

This discussion has been in terms of things that lower alveolar *P*O2 ; just reverse the direction of change of the three factors to see how to increase *P*O2.
