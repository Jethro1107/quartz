## Pelvic outlet

The diamond-shaped pelvic outlet is formed by both bone and ligaments (  [Fig. 5.6](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0035) ). It is limited anteriorly in the midline by the pubic symphysis.

On each side, the inferior margin of the pelvic bone projects posteriorly and laterally from the pubic symphysis to end in a prominent tuberosity, the  **ischial tuberosity** . Together, these elements construct the pubic arch, which forms the margin of the anterior half of the pelvic outlet. The sacrotuberous ligament continues this margin posteriorly from the ischial tuberosity to the coccyx and sacrum. The pubic symphysis, ischial tuberosities, and coccyx can all be palpated.
