# Edema in Patients With Cardiac Failure

## Acute Cardiac Failure Does Not Cause Immediate Peripheral Edema

Acute *left* heart failure can cause rapid congestion of the lungs, with the development of *pulmonary edema* and even death within minutes to hours. However, left or right heart failure is slow to cause *peripheral edema* . This situation can best be explained by referring to [Figure 22-3](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0020) . When a previously healthy heart acutely fails as a pump, the aortic pressure falls, and the right atrial pressure rises. As the cardiac output approaches zero, these two pressures approach each other at an equilibrium value of about 13 mm Hg. Capillary pressure also falls from its normal value of 17 mm Hg to the new equilibrium pressure of 13 mm Hg. Thus, *severe acute cardiac failure often causes a fall rather than a rise in peripheral capillary pressure* . Therefore, animal experiments, as well as experience in humans, have shown that acute cardiac failure almost never causes immediate development of peripheral edema.

## Long-Term Fluid Retention by THE Kidneys Causes Peripheral Edema in Persisting Heart Failure

After the first day or so of overall heart failure or right ventricular heart failure, peripheral edema begins to occur, principally *because of fluid retention by the kidneys* . The retention of fluid increases the mean systemic filling pressure, resulting in an increased tendency for blood to return to the heart. This further elevates the right atrial pressure and returns the arterial pressure back toward normal. Therefore, *the capillary pressure now also rises markedly* , thus causing loss of fluid into the tissues and the development of severe edema.

Reduced renal output of urine during cardiac failure has several known causes.

1. **Decreased glomerular filtration rate.** A decrease in cardiac output has a tendency to reduce the glomerular pressure in the kidneys because of the following: (a) *reduced arterial pressure* ; and (b) *intense sympathetic constriction of the afferent arterioles of the kidney.* As a consequence, except in the mildest degrees of heart failure, the glomerular filtration rate is reduced. It is clear from the discussion of kidney function in [Chapter 27](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000278) , [Chapter 28](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B978032359712800028X) , [Chapter 29](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000291) , [Chapter 30](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000308) that *a decrease in glomerular filtration often markedly decreases urine output.* A fall in the cardiac output to about half-normal can result in almost complete anuria.
2. **Activation of renin-angiotensin system and increased reabsorption of water and salt by renal tubules.** The reduced blood flow to the kidneys causes a marked increase in *renin secretion* by the kidneys, which in turn increases the *formation of angiotensin II* , as described in [Chapter 19](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000199) . Angiotensin II, in turn, has a direct effect on the arterioles of the kidneys to decrease blood flow through the kidneys further, which reduces the pressure in the peritubular capillaries surrounding the renal tubules, promoting greatly increased reabsorption of water and salt from the tubules. Angiotensin II also acts directly on the renal tubular epithelial cells to stimulate reabsorption of salt and water. Therefore, loss of water and salt into the urine decreases greatly, and large quantities of salt and water accumulate in the blood and interstitial fluids throughout the body.
3. **Increased aldosterone secretion.** In the chronic stage of heart failure, large quantities of aldosterone are secreted by the adrenal cortex. This secretion results mainly from the effect of angiotensin II to stimulate aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. However, some of the increase in aldosterone secretion often results from increased plasma potassium concentration. Excess potassium is one of the most powerful stimuli known for aldosterone secretion, and the potassium concentration rises in response to reduced renal function in those with cardiac failure. The elevated aldosterone level further increases reabsorption of sodium from the renal tubules, which in turn leads to a secondary increase in water reabsorption, as discussed in [Chapter 28](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B978032359712800028X) .
4. **Increased antidiuretic hormone secretion.** In advanced heart failure, increased secretion of *antidiuretic hormone* (ADH) may contribute to excessive water reabsorption by the renal tubules. As discussed in [Chapter 28](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B978032359712800028X) , [Chapter 29](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000291) , ADH is secreted by the hypothalamic–posterior pituitary gland system in response to increased extracellular fluid osmolarity, as well as nonosmotic stimuli from low-pressure (e.g., left atrial) and high-pressure (e.g., carotid sinus) baroreceptors. In severe heart failure, the nonosmotic effects of reductions in cardiac output and arterial pressure may predominate to stimulate secretion of ADH, which in turn causes excess water retention and *hyponatremia* (low plasma sodium concentration). Inappropriately high levels of ADH and hyponatremia are predictors for worsening outcomes in patients with heart failure.
5. **Activation of sympathetic nervous system.** As discussed previously, heart failure causes marked activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which in turn has several effects that lead to salt and water retention by the kidneys: (a) constriction of renal afferent arterioles, which reduces the glomerular filtration rate; (b) stimulation of renal tubular reabsorption of salt and water by activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors on tubular epithelial cells; (c) stimulation of renin release and angiotensin II formation, which increases renal tubular reabsorption; and (d) stimulation of ADH release from the posterior pituitary, which then increases water reabsorption by the renal tubules. These effects of sympathetic stimulation are discussed in [Chapter 27](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000278) , [Chapter 28](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B978032359712800028X) .

## Role of Natriuretic Peptides in Delaying Onset of Cardiac Decompensation

*Natriuretic peptides* are hormones released by the heart when it becomes stretched. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is released by the atrial walls, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is released by the ventricular walls. Because heart failure almost always increases the atrial and ventricular pressures that stretch the walls of these chambers, circulating levels of ANP and BNP in the blood may increase severalfold in severe heart failure. These natriuretic peptides, in turn, have a direct effect on the kidneys to increase their excretion of salt and water greatly. Therefore, the natriuretic peptides play a natural role to help prevent extreme congestive symptoms during cardiac failure. Because the half-life of BNP is significantly longer than that of ANP and can be easily measured in the bloodstream, it is often used to diagnose heart failure or to monitor volume status in patients with established heart failure. The renal effects of ANP are discussed in [Chapters 28](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B978032359712800028X) and [30](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000308) .

## Acute Pulmonary Edema in Late-Stage Heart Failure—Another Lethal Vicious Cycle

A frequent cause of death is *acute pulmonary edema* in patients who have already had heart failure for a long time. When acute pulmonary edema occurs in a person without new cardiac damage, it usually is set off by some temporary overload of the heart, such as that which might result from a bout of heavy exercise, an emotional experience, or even a severe cold. The acute pulmonary edema is believed to result from the following vicious cycle:

1. A temporarily increased load on the already weak left ventricle initiates the vicious cycle. Because of limited pumping capacity of the left heart, blood begins to dam up in the lungs.
2. The increased blood in the lungs elevates the pulmonary capillary pressure, and a small amount of fluid begins to transude into the lung tissues and alveoli.
3. The increased fluid in the lungs diminishes the degree of oxygenation of the blood.
4. The decreased oxygen in the blood further weakens the heart and also causes peripheral vasodilation.
5. The peripheral vasodilation further increases venous return of blood from the peripheral circulation.
6. The increased venous return further increases damming of the blood in the lungs, leading to, for example, still more transudation of fluid, more arterial oxygen desaturation, and more venous return. Thus, a vicious cycle has been established.

Once this vicious cycle has proceeded beyond a certain critical point, it will continue until the patient dies, unless successful therapeutic measures are initiated within minutes. The types of measures that can reverse the process and save the patient’s life include the following:

1. Putting tourniquets on both arms and legs to sequester much of the blood in the veins and, therefore, decrease the workload on the left side of the heart
2. Administering a rapidly acting diuretic, such as furosemide, to cause rapid loss of fluid from the body
3. Giving the patient pure oxygen to breathe to reverse the blood oxygen desaturation, heart deterioration, and peripheral vasodilation
4. Administering a rapidly acting cardiotonic drug, such as digitalis, to strengthen the heart

This vicious cycle of acute pulmonary edema can proceed so rapidly that death can occur in 20 to 60 minutes. Therefore, any procedure that is to be successful must be instituted immediately.
