### 23.5.1 Mechanism of Action

- These drugs block the ENaC channels in the distal tubules and the collecting ducts in the cortical region of the nephron. ENaC channels are present on principal cells.
- ENaC channels are responsible for the reabsorption of Na+ resulting in a negative potential in the lumen relative to the luminal membrane of the nephron. (The gradient for this is generated by the Na+K+ATPase present in the basolateral membrane.)
- Blockade of the ENaC channels results in hyperpolarisation of the membrane and prevents the development of the lumen negative transepithelial potential which contributes for the excretion of cations like K+, H+, Ca2+, Mg2+.
- Amiloride is 10 times more potent than triamterene and h
