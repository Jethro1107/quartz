Created time: March 23, 2022 3:01 PM

## Clinical Features

Bronchiectasis causes severe, persistent cough; expectoration of foul smelling, sometimes bloody sputum; dyspnea and orthopnea in severe cases; and, on occasion, hemoptysis, which may be massive. Symptoms are often episodic and are precipitated by upper respiratory tract infections or the introduction of new pathogenic agents. Paroxysms of cough are particularly frequent when the patient rises in the morning, as the change in position causes collections of pus and secretions to drain into the bronchi. Obstructive respiratory insufficiency can lead to marked dyspnea and cyanosis. However, current treatments with better antibiotics and physical therapy have improved outcomes considerably, and life expectancy has almost doubled. Hence, cor pulmonale, brain abscesses, and amyloidosis are less frequent complications of bronchiectasis currently than in the past.
