- Dead Space
    - The conducting airways have a volume of about 150 ml. Exchanges of gases with the blood occur only in the alveoli and not in this 150 ml of the airways. Picture, then, what occurs during expiration of a tidal volume of 500 ml. The 500 ml of air is forced out of the alveoli and through the airways. Approximately 350 ml of this alveolar air is exhaled at the nose or mouth, but approximately 150 ml remains in the airways at the end of expiration. During the next inspiration (Figure 13–19), 500 ml of air flows into the alveoli, but the first 150 ml entering the alveoli is not atmospheric air but the 150 ml left behind in the airways from the last breath. Thus, only 350 ml of new atmospheric air enters the alveoli during the inspiration. The end result is that 150 ml of the 500 ml of atmospheric air entering the respiratory system during each inspiration never reaches the alveoli, but is merely moved in and out of the airways. Because these airways do not permit gas exchange with the blood, the space within them is termed the anatomic dead space (VD).

- Factors affecting alveolar PCO2
    - The story for PCO2 is analogous, again assuming that only one factor changes at a time. There is normally essentially no carbon dioxide in inspired air and so we can ignore that factor. A decreased alveolar ventilation will increase the alveolar PCO2 (see Figure 13–22) because there is less inspired fresh air to dilute the carbon dioxide entering the alveoli from the blood. Increased production of carbon dioxide will also increase the alveolar PCO2 because more carbon dioxide will be entering the alveoli from the blood per unit time. **Recall that in the steady state, the volume of carbon dioxide entering the alveoli per unit time is always equal to the volume produced by the tissues.**

- Factors affecting alveolar PO2
    - The factors that determine the precise value of alveolar PO2 are (1) the PO2 of atmospheric air, (2) the rate of alveolar ventilation, and (3) the rate of total-body oxygen consumption. Although equations exist for calculating the alveolar gas pressures from these variables, we will describe the interactions in a qualitative manner (**Table 13–6**). To start, we will assume that only one of the factors changes at a time.
    - First, a decrease in the PO2 of the inspired air, such as would occur at high altitude, will decrease alveolar PO2.
    - A decrease in alveolar ventilation will decrease the alveolar PO2 because less fresh air is entering the alveoli per unit time.
    - Finally, an increase in the oxygen consumption in the cells (V dot O2) will also lower alveolar PO2 because a larger fraction of the oxygen in the entering fresh air will leave the alveoli to enter the blood for use by the tissues. (Recall that in the steady state, the volume of oxygen entering the blood in the lungs per unit time is always equal to the volume utilized by the tissues.)
