## Shock

**Shock is a state of circulatory failure that impairs tissue perfusion and leads to cellular hypoxia.** At the outset, the cellular injury is reversible; however, prolonged shock eventually leads to irreversible tissue injury and can be fatal. Shock may complicate severe hemorrhage, extensive trauma or burns, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and microbial sepsis. Its causes fall into three general categories ( [Table 4.3](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/t0020) ):

- *Cardiogenic shock* results from low cardiac output due to myocardial pump failure. This can be due to intrinsic myocardial damage (infarction), ventricular arrhythmias, extrinsic compression (cardiac tamponade; [Chapter 11](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B978032353113900011X?scrollTo=%23c00011) ), or outflow obstruction (e.g., pulmonary embolism).
- *Hypovolemic shock* results from low cardiac output due to low blood volume, such as can occur with massive hemorrhage or fluid loss from severe burns.
- *Sepsis, septic shock, and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome* are interrelated and somewhat overlapping conditions. The definitions that follow are based on The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (2016):
    - *Sepsis* is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.
    - *Septic shock* is defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone.
    - *Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)* is a sepsis-like condition associated with systemic inflammation that may be triggered by a variety of nonmicrobial insults, such as burns, trauma, and/or pancreatitis. Pathogenic feature common to SIRS and septic shock is a massive outpouring of inflammatory mediators from innate and adaptive immune cells that produce arterial vasodilation, vascular leakage, and venous blood pooling. With the advent of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, a similar iatrogenic syndrome called *cytokine release syndrome* has been observed in cancer patients. The cardiovascular abnormalities associated with SIRS result in tissue hypoperfusion, cellular hypoxia, and metabolic derangements that lead to organ dysfunction and, if severe and persistent, organ failure and death.
- Less commonly, shock can occur in the setting of a spinal cord injury ( *neurogenic shock* ), or an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction ( *anaphylactic shock,* [Chapter 6](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323531139000066?scrollTo=%23c00006) ). In both of these forms of shock, acute vasodilation leads to hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion.
