**Renal Corpuscles & Blood Filtration**

At the beginning of each nephron is a renal corpuscle, about 200 micrometers in diameter and containing a loose knot of capillaries, the glomerulus, surrounded by a double-walled epithelial capsule called the **glomerular (Bowman's) capsule** (Figures 19–2 and 19–5). The internal layer (**visceral layer**) of the capsule closely envelops the glomerular capillaries . The external **parietal layer** forms the outer surface of the capsule. Between the two capsular layers is the urinary or **capsular space,** which receives the fluid filtered through the capillary wall and the visceral layer. Each renal corpuscle has a **vascular pole,** where the afferent arteriole enters and the efferent arteriole leaves, and a urinary or **tubular pole,** where the proximal convoluted tubule begins (Figure 19–5). After entering the renal corpuscle, the afferent arteriole usually divides and subdivides into the two to five capillaries of the renal glomerulus.

**Renal corpuscles.**

**(a):** The renal corpuscle is a small mass of capillaries called the glomerulus housed within a bulbous glomerular capsule. The internal lining of the capsule is composed of complex epithelial cells called podocytes, which cover each capillary, forming filtration slits between interdigitating processes called pedicels. Blood enters and leaves the glomerulus through the afferent and efferent arterioles respectively. **(b):** The micrograph shows the major histological features of a renal corpuscle. H&E.

The parietal layer of a glomerular capsule consists of a simple squamous epithelium supported externally by a basal lamina and a thin layer of reticular fibers. At the tubular pole, this epithelium changes to the simple cuboidal epithelium characteristic of the proximal tubule (Figure 19–5).

During embryonic development, the simple epithelium of the parietal layer remains relatively unchanged, whereas the internal or visceral layer is greatly modified. The cells of this layer, the **podocytes** (Figures 19–5d and 19–6), have a cell body from which arise several **primary processes.** Each primary process gives rise to numerous **secondary (foot) processes** or **pedicels** (L. pedicellus, little foot) that embrace a portion of one glomerular capillary (Figures 19–5d and 19–6). The cell bodies of podocytes do not contact the basement membrane of the capillary, but each pedicel is in direct contact with this structure (Figure 19–6).
