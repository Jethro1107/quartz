## Plateau in Venous Return Curve at Negative Atrial Pressures Caused by Collapse of the Large Veins

When the right atrial pressure falls *below* zero—that is, below atmospheric pressure—any further increase in venous return almost ceases, and by the time the right atrial pressure has fallen to about −2 mm Hg, the venous return reaches a plateau. It remains at this plateau level, even though the right atrial pressure falls to −20 mm Hg, −50 mm Hg or even further. This plateau is caused by *collapse of the veins* entering the chest. Negative pressure in the right atrium sucks the walls of the veins together where they enter the chest, which prevents any additional flow of blood from the peripheral veins. Consequently, even very negative pressures in the right atrium cannot increase venous return significantly above that which exists at a normal atrial pressure of 0 mm Hg.
