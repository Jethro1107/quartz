# Unilateral Left Heart Failure

Thus far we have considered failure of the heart as a whole. Yet, in a large number of patients, especially those with early acute heart failure, left-sided failure predominates over right-sided failure and, in rare cases, the right side fails without significant failure of the left side.

When the left side of the heart fails without concomitant failure of the right side, blood continues to be pumped into the lungs with usual right heart vigor, whereas it is not pumped adequately out of the lungs by the left heart into the systemic circulation. As a result, the *mean pulmonary filling pressure* rises because of the shift of large volumes of blood from the systemic circulation into the pulmonary circulation.

As the volume of blood in the lungs increases, the pulmonary capillary pressure increases and, if this pressure rises above a value approximately equal to the colloid osmotic pressure of the plasma—about 28 mm Hg—fluid begins to filter out of the capillaries into the lung interstitial spaces and alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema.

Thus, the most important problems of left heart failure include *pulmonary vascular congestion* and *pulmonary edema* . In severe, acute, left heart failure, pulmonary edema occasionally occurs so rapidly that it can cause death by suffocation in 20 to 30 minutes, discussed later in this chapter.

## Low-Output Cardiac Failure—Cardiogenic Shock

In many cases after acute heart attacks, and often after prolonged periods of slow progressive cardiac deterioration, the heart becomes incapable of pumping even the minimal amount of blood flow required to keep the body alive. Consequently, the body tissues begin to suffer and even to deteriorate, often leading to death within a few hours to a few days. The picture, then, is one of circulatory shock, as explained in [Chapter 24](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000242) . Even the cardiovascular system suffers from lack of nutrition and deteriorates, along with the remainder of the body, thus hastening death. This circulatory shock syndrome caused by inadequate cardiac pumping is called *cardiogenic shock* or simply *cardiac shock* . Once cardiogenic shock develops, the survival rate is often less than 30%, even with appropriate medical care.

## Vicious Cycle of Cardiac Deterioration in Cardiogenic Shock

The discussion of circulatory shock in [Chapter 24](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000242) emphasizes the tendency for the heart to become progressively more damaged when its coronary blood supply is reduced during the course of the shock. That is, the low arterial pressure that occurs during shock reduces the coronary blood supply even more. This reduction further weakens the heart, which makes the arterial pressure fall further, which makes the shock progressively worse; the process eventually becomes a vicious cycle of cardiac deterioration. In cardiogenic shock caused by myocardial infarction, this problem is greatly compounded by already existing coronary vessel blockage. For example, in a healthy heart, the arterial pressure usually must be reduced below about 45 mm Hg before cardiac deterioration sets in. However, in a heart that already has a blocked major coronary vessel, deterioration begins when the coronary arterial pressure falls below 80 to 90 mm Hg. In other words, even a small decrease in arterial pressure can now set off a vicious cycle of cardiac deterioration. For this reason, in treating myocardial infarction, it is extremely important to prevent even short periods of hypotension.

## Physiology of Cardiogenic Shock Treatment

Often, a patient dies of cardiogenic shock before the various compensatory processes can return the cardiac output (and arterial pressure) to a life-sustaining level. Therefore, treatment of this condition is one of the most important challenges in the management of acute heart attacks.

Digitalis is often administered immediately to strengthen the heart if the ventricular muscle shows signs of deterioration. Also, infusion of whole blood, plasma, or a blood pressure–raising drug is used to sustain the arterial pressure. If the arterial pressure can be elevated to a high enough level, the coronary blood flow often will increase enough to prevent the vicious cycle of deterioration. This process allows enough time for appropriate compensatory mechanisms in the circulatory system to correct the shock.

Some success has also been achieved in saving the lives of patients in cardiogenic shock by using one of the following procedures: (1) surgically removing the clot in the coronary artery, often in combination with a coronary bypass graft; or (2) catheterizing the blocked coronary artery and infusing *streptokinase* or *tissue-type plasminogen activator* enzymes that causes dissolution of the clot. The results are occasionally astounding when one of these procedures is instituted within the first hour of cardiogenic shock but are of little, if any, benefit after 3 hours.
