# Junqueira’s Histology: Mesangial cell

Created time: March 9, 2022 6:42 PM

In addition to capillary endothelial cells and podocytes, renal corpuscles also contain **mesangial cells** (Gr. *mesos,* in the midst, + *angeion,* vessel) (Figure 19–7), which resemble pericytes in producing components of an enveloping external lamina. Mesangial cells are difficult to distinguish in routine sections form podocytes, but often stain more darkly. They and their surrounding matrix comprise the mesangium (Figure 19–7), which fills interstices between capillaries that lack podocytes. Functions of the mesangium are many and varied, and include the following:

Physical support and contraction—the mesangium provides internal structural support to the glomerulus and like pericytes, its cells respond to vasoactive substances to help maintain hydrostatic pressure for the optimal rate of filtration.

Phagocytosis—mesangial cells phagocytose protein aggregates that adhere to the glomerular filter, including antibody-antigen complexes abundant in many pathological conditions.

Secretion—the cells synthesize and secrete several cytokines, prostaglandins, and other factors important for immune defense and repair in the glomerulus.

**(a):** Diagram showing that mesangial cells in renal corpuscles are located between capillaries and are enveloped by a dense extracellular matrix like that of the basement membrane around the capillaries. **(b):** The TEM shows one mesangial cell (MC) and the amorphous mesangial matrix (MM) surrounding it. This matrix appears similar and in many places continuous with basement membrane (BM). The matrix helps support capillary loops where podocytes are lacking. Mesangial cells extend processes (arrows) around capillaries which may affect their state of contraction. Some mesangial processes appear to pass between endothelial cells (EC) into the capillary lumen (asterisks) where they may help remove or endocytose adherent protein aggregates. The capillary at the left contains an erythrocyte (E) and a leukocyte (L). Podocytes (P) and their pedicels (PD) open to the urinary space (US) and associate with the capillary surfaces not covered by mesangial cells.
