## Vascular Function Curve

The vascular function curve or venous return curve, shown in [Figure 4.26](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0135) , depicts the relationship between venous return and right atrial pressure. Venous return is blood flow through the systemic circulation and back to the right heart. The *inverse relationship* between venous return and right atrial pressure is explained as follows: Venous return back to the heart, like all blood flow, is driven by a pressure gradient. The lower the pressure in the right atrium, the higher the pressure gradient between the systemic arteries and the right atrium and the greater the venous return. Thus as right atrial pressure increases, this pressure gradient decreases and venous return also decreases.

The **knee** (flat portion) of the vascular function curve occurs at negative values of right atrial pressure. At such negative values, the veins collapse, impeding blood flow back to the heart. Although the pressure gradient has increased (i.e., as right atrial pressure becomes negative), venous return levels off because the veins have collapsed, creating a resistance to blood flow.

## Mean Systemic Pressure

The value for right atrial pressure at which venous return is zero is called the mean systemic pressure. It is the point at which the vascular function curve intersects the X-axis (i.e., where venous return is zero and right atrial pressure is at its highest value). **Mean systemic pressure** or mean circulatory pressure is the pressure that would be measured throughout the cardiovascular system if the heart were stopped. Under these conditions, pressure would be the same throughout the vasculature and, by our definition, would be equal to the mean systemic pressure. When pressures are equal throughout the vasculature, there is no blood flow, and therefore venous return is zero (because there is no pressure gradient or driving force).

Two factors influence the value for mean systemic pressure: (1) the **blood volume** and (2) the **distribution of blood** between the unstressed volume and the stressed volume. In turn, the value for mean systemic pressure determines the intersection point (zero flow) of the vascular function curve with the X-axis.

[Figure 4.27](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0140) reviews the concepts of unstressed volume and stressed volume and relates them to mean systemic pressure. The **unstressed volume** (thought of as the *volume of blood that the veins can hold* ) is the volume of blood in the vasculature that produces no pressure. The **stressed volume** (thought of as the *volume in the arteries* ) is the volume that produces pressure by stretching the elastic fibers in the blood vessel walls.

- Consider the effect of **changing blood volume** on mean systemic pressure. When the blood volume ranges from 0 to 4 L, all of the blood will be in the unstressed volume (the veins), producing no pressure, and the mean systemic pressure will be zero. When blood volume is greater than 4 L, some of the blood will be in the stressed volume (the arteries) and produce pressure. For example, if the total blood volume is 5 L, 4 L is in the unstressed volume, producing no pressure, and 1 L is in the stressed volume, producing a pressure of approximately 7 mm Hg (on the graph, read mean systemic pressure as 7 mm Hg at a blood volume of 5 L).
    
    It now should be clear how changes in blood volume can alter the mean systemic pressure (see [Fig. 4.26](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0135) ). If **blood volume increases,** the amount of blood in the unstressed volume will be unaffected (if it is already full), but the amount of blood in the stressed volume will increase. When stressed volume increases, mean systemic pressure increases and the vascular function curve and its intersection point with the X-axis shift to the right. If **blood volume decreases,** then stressed volume decreases, mean systemic pressure decreases, and the vascular function curve and its intersection point with the X-axis shift to the left.
    
- **Redistribution of blood** between the unstressed volume and the stressed volume also produces changes in mean systemic pressure. For example, if the **compliance of the veins decreases** (e.g., venoconstriction), the veins can hold less blood and blood shifts from the unstressed volume to the stressed volume. Although total blood volume is unchanged, the shift of blood increases the mean systemic pressure and shifts the vascular function curve to the right. Conversely, if **the compliance of the veins increases** (e.g., venodilation), the veins can hold more blood. Hence, the unstressed volume will increase, the stressed volume and mean systemic pressure will decrease, and the vascular function curve shifts to the left.

Effect of changes in stressed volume on mean systemic pressure.Total blood volume is the sum of unstressed volume (in the veins) and stressed volume (in the arteries). Increases in stressed volume produce increases in mean systemic pressure.

In summary, increased blood volume and decreased compliance of the veins produce an increase in mean systemic pressure and shift the vascular function curve to the right. Decreased blood volume and increased compliance of the veins produce a decrease in mean systemic pressure and shift the vascular function curve to the left.

## Slope of the Vascular Function Curve

If mean systemic pressure is fixed or constant, the slope of the vascular function curve can be changed by rotating it. The slope of the vascular function curve is determined by **total peripheral resistance (TPR).** Recall that TPR is determined primarily by the resistance of the arterioles. The effect of TPR on venous return and the vascular function curve is explained as follows (see [Fig. 4.26](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0135) ):

- ♦
    
    A **decrease in TPR** causes a *clockwise* rotation of the vascular function curve. A clockwise rotation means that, for a given right atrial pressure, venous return is increased. In other words, decreased resistance of the arterioles (decreased TPR) makes it *easier* for blood to flow from the arterial to the venous side of the circulation and back to the heart.
    
- ♦
    
    An **increase in TPR** causes a *counterclockwise* rotation of the vascular function curve. A counterclockwise rotation means that, for a given right atrial pressure, venous return is decreased. In other words, increased resistance of the arterioles (increased TPR) makes it *more difficult* for blood to flow from the arterial to the venous side of the circulation and back to the heart.
