**KEY CONCEPTS**

**The Nephrotic Syndrome**

- Membranous nephropathy is caused by an autoimmune response, most often directed against the PLA 2 R on podocytes; it is characterized by granular subepithelial deposits of antibodies with GBM thickening and loss of foot processes but little or no inflammation; the disease is often resistant to steroid therapy.
- The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria, which results in hypoalbuminemia and edema.
- Podocyte injury is an underlying mechanism of proteinuria, and may be the result of nonimmune causes (as in minimal change disease and FSGS) or immune mechanisms (as in membranous nephropathy).
- Minimal change disease is the most frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome in children; it is manifested by proteinuria and effacement of glomerular foot processes without antibody deposits; the pathogenesis is unknown; secondary forms can be triggered by infections, immunization, drugs, and certain neoplastic lesions; the disease responds well to steroid therapy.
- FSGS may be primary (podocyte injury by unknown mechanisms) or secondary (e.g., as a consequence of prior glomerulonephritis, hypertension, or infection such as HIV); glomeruli show focal and segmental obliteration of capillary lumens, and loss of foot processes; the disease is often resistant to therapy and may progress to ESRD.
- MPGN in most cases is the result of immune complex deposition in both mesangial regions and capillary walls. It may be associated with systemic infections.
- Dense deposit disease (formerly type II MPGN), defined by a unique permeation of GBMs by electron dense material, primarily affects children and young adults. It is associated with acquired or genetic dysregulation of the alternate pathway of complement.
- Fibrillary glomerulonephritis is a rare disease characterized by Congo-red negative fibrillary glomerular deposits of unknown etiology.
