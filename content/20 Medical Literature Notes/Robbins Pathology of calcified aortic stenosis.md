# Robbins: Pathology of calcified aortic stenosis

Created time: April 18, 2022 11:36 AM

The gross morphologic hallmark of nonrheumatic, calcific aortic stenosis (involving either tricuspid or bicuspid valves) is mounded calcified masses on the outflow surfaces of the cusps that ultimately prevent cuspal opening. The free edges of the cusps are usually not involved (  [Fig. 12.20A](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0105)
 ). Microscopically, the layered architecture of the valve is largely preserved. The calcific process begins in the valvular fibrosa on the outflow surface of the valve, at the points of maximal cusp flexion (near the margins of attachment). Inflammation is variable, and metaplastic bone can be seen. In aortic stenosis, the functional valve area is decreased by large nodular calcific deposits that can eventually cause measurable outflow obstruction; this subjects the left ventricular myocardium to progressively increasing pressure overload. In contrast with rheumatic (and congenital) aortic stenosis (see  [Fig. 12.22E](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0115)
 ), commissural fusion is not usually seen.

Calcific valvular degeneration. (A) Calcific aortic stenosis of a previously normal valve (viewed from aortic aspect). Nodular masses of calcium are heaped up within the sinuses of Valsalva  *(arrow)*  . Note that the commissures are not fused, as occurs with postrheumatic aortic valve stenosis (see [Fig. 12.22E](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0115)  ). (B) Calcific aortic stenosis of a congenitally bicuspid valve. One cusp has a partial fusion at its center, called a raphe  *(arrow)*  . (C and D) Mitral annular calcification, with calcific nodules at the base (attachment margin) of the anterior mitral leaflet  *(arrows)*  . (C) Left atrial view. (D) Cut section of myocardium showing the lateral wall with dense calcification that extends into the underlying myocardium  *(arrow)*  .
