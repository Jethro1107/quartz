# Gray’s Anatomy: Location of suprarenal gland

Created time: March 6, 2022 12:10 PM

## Suprarenal glands

The suprarenal glands are associated with the superior pole of each kidney (  [Fig. 4.163](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0750) ). They consist of an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The right gland is shaped like a pyramid, whereas the left gland is semilunar in shape and the larger of the two.

Anterior to the right suprarenal gland is part of the right lobe of the liver and the inferior vena cava, whereas anterior to the left suprarenal gland is part of the stomach, pancreas, and, on occasion, the spleen. Parts of the diaphragm are posterior to both glands.

The suprarenal glands are surrounded by the perinephric fat and enclosed in the renal fascia, though a thin septum separates each gland from its associated kidney.
