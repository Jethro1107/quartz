## Cellular and Molecular Hallmarks of Cancer

Over the past several decades, hundreds of genes that are mutated in cancer have been discovered. Traditionally, the functional consequences of these alterations were described one gene at a time. However, the blizzard of mutated genes emerging from the sequencing of cancer genomes has blanketed the landscape and revealed the limitations of trying to grasp the fundamental properties of cancer gene by gene. For example, compilation of a partially complete catalog of recurrent genetic alterations in breast carcinoma required whole genomic sequencing of thousands of tumors and led to the identification of hundreds of distinct driver mutations—and this is just one of hundreds of different kinds of cancer, some of which are substantially more genetically complex than breast carcinoma.

A more tractable and conceptually satisfying way to think about the biology of cancer is to consider the common biologic properties that are imparted to cancer cells by their diverse genomic and epigenomic alterations. It appears that **all cancers display eight fundamental changes in cell physiology, which are considered the hallmarks of cancer.** These changes are illustrated in [Fig. 7.21](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0110) and consist of the following:

- *Self-sufficiency in growth signals.* Tumors have the capacity to proliferate without external stimuli, usually as a consequence of oncogene activation.
- *Insensitivity to growth-inhibitory signals.* Tumors may not respond to molecules that inhibit the proliferation of normal cells, usually because of inactivation of tumor suppressor genes that encode components of growth inhibitory pathways.
- *Altered cellular metabolism.* Tumor cells undergo a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis (called the *Warburg effect* ), which enables the synthesis of the macromolecules and organelles that are needed for rapid cell growth.
- *Evasion of apoptosis.* Tumors are resistant to programmed cell death.
- *Limitless replicative potential (immortality).* Tumors have unrestricted proliferative capacity, a stem cell–like property that permits tumor cells to avoid cellular senescence and mitotic catastrophe.
- *Sustained angiogenesis.* Tumor cells, like normal cells, are not able to grow without a vascular supply to bring nutrients and oxygen and remove waste products. Hence, tumors must induce angiogenesis.
- *Ability to invade and metastasize.* Tumor metastases are the cause of the vast majority of cancer deaths and arise from the interplay of processes that are intrinsic to tumor cells and signals that are initiated by the tissue environment.
- *Ability to evade the host immune response.* You will recall that the cells of the innate and adaptive immune system can recognize and eliminate cells displaying abnormal antigens (e.g., a mutated oncoprotein). Cancer cells exhibit a number of alterations that allow them to evade the host immune response.

The acquisition of the genetic and epigenetic alterations that confer these hallmarks may be accelerated by *genomic instability* and by *cancer-promoting inflammation* . These are considered enabling characteristics because they promote cellular transformation and subsequent tumor progression.

In the following sections, each of the hallmarks and enabling characteristics of cancer cells is discussed, focusing on the most important contributing genes and cellular pathways. The discussion of cancer pathophysiology ends with a review of the roles that epigenetic changes and noncoding RNAs play in the disease.
