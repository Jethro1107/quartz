# Robbins: Small cell lung carcinoma

Created time: May 3, 2022 11:36 AM

**Small cell carcinoma** is a highly malignant tumor with a strong relationship to cigarette smoking; only about 1% occurs in nonsmokers. Tumors may arise in major bronchi or in the periphery of the lung. There is no known pre-invasive phase. They are the most aggressive of lung tumors, metastasizing widely and virtually always proving to be fatal.

Small cell carcinoma is comprised of relatively small cells with scant cytoplasm, ill-defined cell borders, finely granular nuclear chromatin (salt and pepper pattern), and absent or inconspicuous nucleoli (see [Fig. 15.43C](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0220) ). The cells are round, oval, or spindle-shaped, and nuclear molding is prominent. There is no absolute size for the tumor cells, but in general they are smaller than three times the diameter of a small resting lymphocyte (a size of about 25 µm). The mitotic count is high. The cells grow in clusters that exhibit neither glandular nor squamous organization. Necrosis is common and often extensive. Basophilic staining of vascular walls due to encrustation by DNA from necrotic tumor cells (Azzopardi effect) is frequently present. Combined small cell carcinoma is a variant in which typical small cell carcinoma is mixed with non–small cell histologies, such as large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma or even spindled cell morphologies resembling sarcoma.

Electron microscopy shows dense-core neurosecretory granules, about 100 nm in diameter, in two-thirds of cases of small cell carcinoma. The occurrence of neurosecretory granules; the expression of neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56; and the ability of some of these tumors to secrete hormones (e.g., parathormone-related protein, a cause of paraneoplastic hypercalcemia) suggest that this tumor originates from neuroendocrine progenitor cells, which are present in the lining bronchial epithelium. This simplistic idea is challenged, however, by the existence of tumors comprised of a mixture of small cell carcinoma and other histologies and well-documented “transformations” of non–small cell carcinoma to small cell carcinoma. Among the various types of lung cancer, small cell carcinoma is the one that is most commonly associated with ectopic hormone production (discussed later).
