# Gray’s Anatomy: Base and apex of the heart

Created time: March 7, 2022 6:28 PM

## **Base (posterior surface) and apex**

The base of the heart is quadrilateral and directed posteriorly. It consists of:

▪ the left atrium,
▪ a small portion of the right atrium, and
▪ the proximal parts of the great veins (superior and inferior venae cavae and the pulmonary veins) ( Fig. 3.64 ).

Base of the heart.

Because the great veins enter the base of the heart, with the pulmonary veins entering the right and left sides of the left atrium and the superior and inferior venae cavae at the upper and lower ends of the right atrium, the base of the heart is fixed posteriorly to the pericardial wall, opposite the bodies of vertebrae TV to TVIII (TVI to TIX when standing). The esophagus lies immediately posterior to the base.
From the base the heart projects forward, downward, and to the left, ending in the apex. The apex of the heart is formed by the inferolateral part of the left ventricle ( Fig. 3.65 ) and is positioned deep to the left fifth intercostal space, 8 to 9 cm from the midsternal line.
