Tidal volume (in terms of volume of expired air) is the sum of volume air in alveoli and volume of air in dead space

By multiplying the terms with the corresponding Fractional concentration of CO2, the second equation is derived

Note that all of the mixed expired CO2 is contributed by alveolar gas and none from dead space

Further rearrangement of the equation gives rise to Bohrâ€™s equation

Note that arterial PCO2 is equal to alveolar PCO2, such that it can be directly substituted in
