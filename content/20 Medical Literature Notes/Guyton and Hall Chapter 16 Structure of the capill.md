## Structure of the Capillary Wall

**[Figure 16-2](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0015)** shows the ultramicroscopic structure of typical endothelial cells in the capillary wall as found in most organs of the body, especially in muscles and connective tissue. Note that the wall is composed of a unicellular layer of endothelial cells and is surrounded by a thin basement membrane on the outside of the capillary. The total thickness of the capillary wall is only about 0.5 micrometer. The internal diameter of the capillary is 4 to 9 micrometers, barely large enough for red blood cells and other blood cells to squeeze through.

It is believed that most water-soluble substances diffuse through the capillary membrane along the clefts. Small membrane invaginations, called *caveolae* , are believed to play a role in transporting macromolecules across the cell membrane. Caveolae contain caveolins, which are proteins that interact with cholesterol and polymerize to form the caveolae.

## Pores in the Capillary Membrane

**[Figure 16-2](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0015)** shows two small passageways connecting the interior of the capillary with the exterior. One of these passageways is an *intercellular cleft,* which is the thin-slitted, curving channel that lies at the top of the figure between adjacent endothelial cells. Each cleft is interrupted periodically by short ridges of protein attachments that hold the endothelial cells together but, between these ridges, fluid can percolate freely through the cleft. The cleft normally has a uniform spacing, with a width of about 6 to 7 nanometers (60 to 70 angstroms [Å]), which is slightly smaller than the diameter of an albumin protein molecule.

Because the intercellular clefts are located only at the edges of the endothelial cells, they usually represent no more than 1/1000 of the total surface area of the capillary wall. Nevertheless, the rate of thermal motion of water molecules, as well as most water-soluble ions and small solutes, is so rapid that all these substances diffuse with ease between the interior and exterior of the capillaries through these *slit pores* , the intercellular clefts.

Present in the endothelial cells are many minute *plasmalemmal vesicles* , also called *caveolae* (small caves). These plasmalemmal vesicles form from oligomers of proteins called *caveolins* that are associated with molecules of *cholesterol* and *sphingolipids* . Although the precise functions of caveolae are still unclear, they are believed to play a role in *endocytosis* (the process whereby the cell engulfs material from outside the cell) and *transcytosis* of macromolecules across the interior of the endothelial cells. The caveolae at the surface of the cell appear to imbibe small packets of plasma or extracellular fluid that contain plasma proteins. These vesicles can then move slowly through the endothelial cell. Some of these vesicles may coalesce to form *vesicular channels* all the way through the endothelial cell, as shown in **[Figure 16-2](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0015)** .
