## Ischemic Heart Disease

**IHD represents a group of related entities resulting from myocardial ischemia—an imbalance between myocardial supply (perfusion) and cardiac demand for oxygenated blood.** Ischemia not only limits tissue oxygenation (and thus ATP generation), but also reduces the availability of nutrients and the removal of metabolic wastes ( [Chapter 2](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323531139000029?scrollTo=%23c00002) ). Thus, cardiac ischemia is generally less well tolerated than hypoxemia per se, such as may occur with severe anemia, cyanotic heart disease, or advanced lung disease.

In more than 90% of cases, myocardial ischemia results from reduced blood flow due to obstructive atherosclerotic lesions in the epicardial coronary arteries; consequently, IHD is frequently referred to as coronary artery disease (CAD). In most cases, there is a long period (up to decades) of silent, slow progression of coronary lesions before the sudden onset of symptoms. Thus, IHD is often the late manifestation of coronary atherosclerosis that began during childhood or adolescence ( [Chapter 11](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B978032353113900011X?scrollTo=%23c00011) ).

IHD can declare itself through one or more of the following clinical presentations:

- *Myocardial infarction (MI),* in which ischemia causes frank cardiac necrosis
- *Angina pectoris* (literally “chest pain”), in which ischemia is not severe enough to cause infarction, but the symptoms nevertheless portend infarction risk
- *Chronic IHD* with heart failure
- *Sudden cardiac death (SCD)*

In addition to coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia can be caused by coronary emboli, myocardial vessel inflammation, or vascular spasm. Moreover, otherwise modest coronary artery occlusions may become consequential in the setting of increased cardiac energy demand (e.g., myocardial hypertrophy or increased heart rate), hypoxemia, or systemic hypotension (e.g., shock). Some conditions can have multiple deleterious effects. Thus, tachycardia increases oxygen demand (because of more contractions per unit time) while decreasing functional supply (by decreasing the relative time spent in diastole, when cardiac perfusion occurs).
