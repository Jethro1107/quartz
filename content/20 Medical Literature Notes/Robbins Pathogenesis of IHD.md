    ## Pathogenesis
    
    The dominant cause of IHD syndromes is insufficient coronary perfusion relative to myocardial demand; in the vast majority of cases, this is due to either of the following:
    
    - *Chronic,* progressive atherosclerotic narrowing of the epicardial coronary arteries
    - Variable degrees of superimposed *acute* plaque change, thrombosis, and vasospasm.
    
    The individual elements and their interactions are discussed next.
    
    ## Chronic Vascular Occlusion
    
    More than 90% of patients with IHD have atherosclerosis involving one or more of the epicardial coronary arteries ( [Chapter 11](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B978032353113900011X?scrollTo=%23c00011) ). A fixed lesion obstructing greater than 70% of vascular cross-sectional area (so called “critical stenosis”) is typically cited as the threshold for symptomatic ischemia precipitated by exercise (characteristically manifesting as exertional angina). With this degree of obstruction, compensatory coronary arterial vasodilation is no longer sufficient to meet even moderate increases in myocardial demand. Obstruction of 90% of the cross-sectional area of the lumen generally leads to inadequate coronary blood flow, even at rest. Slowly developing obstructions induce the formation of collateral circulation that can mitigate the effects of even high-grade stenoses by allowing alternate channels to perfuse at-risk myocardium. Consequently, rather than just assessing the extent of local vascular stenosis, measurements of coronary flow across the stenosis (flow reserves) provide a better assessment of the consequences of fixed coronary artery occlusions, particularly when multifocal.
    
    Although only a single major coronary epicardial vessel may be affected, two or all three—the left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX), and right coronary artery (RCA)—are often involved simultaneously by obstructive atherosclerosis. Clinically significant plaques can be located anywhere along the course of the vessels, although they tend to predominate within the first several centimeters of the LAD and LCX. Sometimes the major epicardial branches are also involved (i.e., LAD diagonal branches, LCX obtuse marginal branches, or posterior descending branch of the RCA), but atherosclerosis of the intramyocardial (penetrating) branches is rare. Thus, most atherosclerotic stenoses can be accessed by coronary catheterization.
    
    ## Acute Plaque Change
    
    The risk of an individual developing clinically important IHD depends in part on the number, distribution, structure, and degree of obstruction by atheromatous plaques. However, the varied clinical manifestations of IHD cannot be explained by the anatomic disease burden and fixed stenoses alone. This is particularly true for the so-called acute coronary syndromes, namely when unstable angina, acute MI, and sudden death are caused abruptly by acute plaque changes. These acute coronary syndromes are typically initiated by an unpredictable and sudden conversion of a stable atherosclerotic plaque to an unstable and potentially life-threatening atherothrombotic lesion through rupture, superficial erosion, ulceration, fissuring, or deep hemorrhage (collectively called acute plaque change) ( [Chapter 11](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B978032353113900011X?scrollTo=%23c00011) ). In most instances, acute plaque changes—typically associated with intralesional inflammation—precipitate the formation of a superimposed thrombus that partially or completely occludes the artery. It remains to be seen whether aggressive anti-inflammatory regimens are a means to reduce such acute coronary events.

    ## Pathogenesis
    
    **IHD is a consequence of inadequate coronary perfusion relative to myocardial demand, usually as a consequence of a preexisting (“fixed”) atherosclerotic occlusion of the coronary arteries and new, superimposed thrombosis and/or vasospasm.** Atherosclerotic narrowing can affect any of the coronary arteries—left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX), and right coronary artery (RCA)—singly or in combination. Clinically significant plaques tend to occur within the first several centimeters of the LAD and LCX takeoff from the aorta, and along the entire length of the RCA. Sometimes, secondary branches also are involved (i.e., diagonal branches of the LAD, obtuse marginal branches of the LCX, or posterior descending branch of the RCA).
    
    Fixed obstructions that occlude less than 70% of a coronary vessel lumen typically are asymptomatic, even with exertion. In comparison, lesions that occlude more than 70% of a vessel lumen—resulting in so-called “critical stenosis”—generally cause symptoms in the setting of increased demand; with critical stenosis, certain levels of exertion predictably cause chest pain, and the patient is said to have *stable angina.* A fixed stenosis that occludes 90% or more of a vascular lumen can lead to inadequate coronary blood flow with symptoms even at rest—one of the forms of *unstable angina* (see “ [Angina Pectoris](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/s0215) ” later in the chapter).
    
    Of importance, if an atherosclerotic lesion progressively occludes a coronary artery at a sufficiently slow rate over years, other coronary vessels may undergo remodeling and provide compensatory blood flow to the area at risk; such *collateral perfusion* can subsequently protect against MI, even if the original vessel becomes completely occluded. Unfortunately, with acute coronary blockage, there is no time for collateral flow to develop and infarction results.
    
    The following elements contribute to the development and consequences of coronary atherosclerosis:
    
    - *Inflammation plays an essential role at all stages of atherosclerosis,* from inception to plaque rupture ( [Chapter 10](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323353175000107?scrollTo=%23c00010) ). It begins with the interaction of endothelial cells and circulating leukocytes, resulting in T-cell and macrophage recruitment and activation. These cells drive subsequent smooth muscle cell accumulation and proliferation, with associated matrix production, superimposed on an atheromatous core of lipid, cholesterol, calcification, and necrotic debris. At later stages, destabilization of atherosclerotic plaque can occur through macrophage metalloproteinase secretion.
    - *Thrombosis associated with an eroded or ruptured plaque triggers the acute coronary syndromes.* Partial vascular occlusion by a newly formed thrombus on a disrupted atherosclerotic plaque can wax and wane with time and lead to unstable angina or sudden death; alternatively, even partial luminal occlusion by a thrombus can compromise blood flow sufficiently to cause a infarction of the innermost zone of the myocardium *(subendocardial infarct).* Organizing thrombi produce potent activators of smooth muscle proliferation, which can contribute to the growth of atherosclerotic lesions. Mural thrombi in a coronary artery can also embolize; indeed, small emboli can be found in the distal intramyocardial circulation (along with associated microinfarcts) at autopsy of patients with unstable angina. In the most serious case, completely obstructive thrombus over a disrupted plaque can cause massive MI.
    - *Vasoconstriction* directly compromises lumen diameter; moreover, by increasing local mechanical shear forces, vessel spasm can potentiate plaque disruption. Vasoconstriction in atherosclerotic plaques can be stimulated by the following:
        - Circulating adrenergic agonists
        - Locally released platelet contents
        - Imbalance between endothelial cell–relaxing factors (e.g., nitric oxide) and –contracting factors (e.g., endothelin) due to endothelial dysfunction
        - Mediators released from perivascular inflammatory cells
    
    ## Acute Plaque Change
    
    Onset of myocardial ischemia depends not only on the extent and severity of fixed atherosclerotic disease but also on dynamic changes in coronary plaque morphology. **In most patients, unstable angina, infarction, and sudden cardiac death occur because of abrupt plaque change followed by thrombosis—hence the term *acute coronary syndrome*** ( [Fig. 11.7](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0040) ).

    The initiating event is typically a sudden disruption (ranging from erosion to rupture) of a partially occlusive plaque. More than one mechanism of injury may be involved: *rupture, fissuring, or ulceration* of plaques expose highly thrombogenic constituents or underlying subendothelial basement membrane, leading to rapid thrombosis. In addition, hemorrhage into the core of plaques can expand plaque volume, thereby acutely exacerbating the degree of luminal occlusion.
    
    Factors that trigger plaque erosion include endothelial injury and apoptosis, likely attributable to some combination of inflammatory and toxic exposures. Acute plaque rupture, on the other hand, involves factors that influence plaque susceptibility to disruption by mechanical stress. These include intrinsic aspects of plaque composition and structure ( [Chapter 10](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323353175000107?scrollTo=%23c00010) ) and extrinsic factors, such as blood pressure and platelet reactivity:
    
    - *Plaques that contain large atheromatous cores or have thin overlying fibrous caps are more likely to rupture and are therefore termed vulnerable.* Fissures frequently occur at the junction of the fibrous cap and the adjacent normal plaque-free arterial segment, where the mechanical stresses are highest and the fibrous cap is thinnest. Fibrous caps also are continuously remodeling; their overall balance of collagen synthesis versus degradation determines mechanical strength and plaque stability. Collagen is produced by smooth muscle cells and degraded by the action of metalloproteases elaborated by macrophages. Consequently, atherosclerotic lesions with a paucity of smooth muscle cells or large numbers of inflammatory cells are vulnerable to rupture. Of interest, statins (inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl Co-A reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis) can provide additional benefit in CAD and IHD by reducing plaque inflammation and increasing plaque stability, effects distinct from and their primary cholesterol-lowering activity.
    - *Influences extrinsic to the plaque also are important.* Adrenergic stimulation can put physical stress on the plaque by causing hypertension or local vasospasm. Indeed, the surge in adrenergic stimulation associated with awakening and rising may underlie the observation that the incidence of acute MI is highest between 6 am and 12 noon. Intense emotional stress also leads to adrenergic stimulation, explaining the association of natural catastrophes such as earthquakes and floods with secondary waves of MIs in susceptible individuals.
    
    In a majority of cases, the “culprit lesion” in patients who suffer an MI was not critically stenotic or even symptomatic before its rupture. As noted previously, anginal symptoms typically occur with fixed lesions exhibiting greater than 70% chronic occlusion. Pathologic and clinical studies show that two thirds of ruptured plaques are less than or equal to 50% stenotic before plaque rupture, and 85% exhibit initial stenotic occlusion of less than or equal to 70%. Thus, the worrisome conclusion is that a large number of asymptomatic adults are at significant risk for a catastrophic coronary event. At present, it is impossible to predict plaque rupture in any given patient.
    
    Plaque disruption and ensuing non-occlusive thrombosis also are common, repetitive, and often clinically silent complications of atheromas. The healing of such subclinical plaque disruption and overlying thrombosis is an important mechanism by which atherosclerotic lesions progressively enlarge ( [Fig. 11.7](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0040) ).
