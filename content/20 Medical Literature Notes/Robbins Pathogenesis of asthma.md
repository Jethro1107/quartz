## Pathogenesis

**Atopic asthma, the most common form of the disease, is caused by a Th2-mediated IgE response to environmental allergens in genetically predisposed individuals.** Airway inflammation is central to the disease pathophysiology and causes airway dysfunction partly through the release of potent inflammatory mediators and partly through remodeling of the airway wall. As the disease becomes more severe, there is increased local secretion of growth factors, which induce mucous gland enlargement, smooth muscle proliferation, angiogenesis, and fibrosis. Varying combinations of these processes help explain the different asthma subtypes, their response to treatment, and their natural history over a person's lifetime.

The contributions of the immune response, genetics, and environment are discussed separately below, although they are closely intertwined.

### Th2 Responses, IgE, and Inflammation

**A fundamental abnormality in asthma is an exaggerated Th2 response to normally harmless environmental antigens** ( [Fig. 15.10](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0055) ). Th2 cells secrete cytokines that promote inflammation and stimulate B cells to produce IgE and other antibodies. These cytokines include IL-4, which stimulates the production of IgE; IL-5, which activates locally recruited eosinophils; and IL-13, which stimulates mucus secretion from bronchial submucosal glands and also promotes IgE production by B cells. The T cells and epithelial cells secrete chemokines that recruit more T cells and eosinophils, thus exacerbating the reaction. As in other allergic reactions ( [Chapter 6](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323531139000066?scrollTo=%23c00006) ), IgE binds to the Fc receptors on submucosal mast cells, and repeat exposure to the allergen triggers the mast cells to release granule contents and produce cytokines and other mediators, which collectively induce the early-phase (immediate hypersensitivity) reaction and the late-phase reaction.

The asthmatic airway is marked by accumulation of mucus in the bronchial lumen secondary to an increase in the number of mucus-secreting goblet cells in the mucosa and hypertrophy of submucosal glands; intense chronic inflammation due to recruitment of eosinophils, macrophages, and other inflammatory cells; thickened basement membrane; and hypertrophy and hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells. (C) Inhaled allergens (antigen) elicit a Th2-dominated response favoring IgE production and eosinophil recruitment. (D) On re-exposure to antigen, the immediate reaction is triggered by antigen-induced cross-linking of IgE bound to Fc receptors on mast cells. These cells release preformed mediators that directly and via neuronal reflexes induce bronchospasm, increased vascular permeability, mucus production, and recruitment of leukocytes. (E) Leukocytes recruited to the site of reaction (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils; lymphocytes and monocytes) release additional mediators that initiate the late phase reaction. Several factors released from eosinophils (e.g., major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein) also cause damage to the epithelium. *IL-5,* Interleukin-5.

The early-phase reaction is dominated by bronchoconstriction, increased mucus production, variable degrees of vasodilation, and increased vascular permeability. Bronchoconstriction is triggered by direct stimulation of subepithelial vagal (parasympathetic) receptors through both central and local reflexes triggered by mediators produced by mast cells and other cells in the reaction. The late-phase reaction is dominated by recruitment of leukocytes, notably eosinophils, neutrophils, and more T cells. Although Th2 cells are the dominant T-cell type involved in the disease, other T cells that contribute to the inflammation include Th17 (IL-17 producing) cells, which recruit neutrophils.

Many mediators produced by leukocytes and epithelial cells have been implicated in the asthmatic response. The long list of “suspects” in acute asthma can be ranked based on the clinical efficacy of pharmacologic intervention with antagonists of specific mediators.

- Mediators whose role in bronchospasm is clearly supported by efficacy of pharmacologic intervention are (1) *leukotrienes C 4 , D 4 ,* and *E 4 ,* which cause prolonged bronchoconstriction as well as increased vascular permeability and increased mucus secretion; (2) *acetylcholine,* released from intrapulmonary parasympathetic nerves, which can cause airway smooth muscle constriction by directly stimulating muscarinic receptors; (3) *IL-5,* antagonists of which are effective in treating severe forms of asthma that are associated with peripheral blood eosinophilia; and (4) *galectin-10* (GAL10), which is released from eosinophils and forms crystals known as *Charcot-Leyden crystals* . Long recognized as a feature of asthma, recent studies have shown that these crystals are strong inducers of inflammation and mucus production.
- A second group of agents are present at the “scene of the crime” but seem to have relatively minor contributions on the basis of lack of efficacy of potent antagonists or synthesis inhibitors. These include (1) *histamine,* a potent bronchoconstrictor; (2) *prostaglandin D 2 ,* which elicits bronchoconstriction and vasodilation; and (3) *platelet-activating factor,* which causes aggregation of platelets and release of serotonin from their granules. These mediators might yet prove important in certain types of chronic or non-allergic asthma.
- Finally, a large third group comprises “suspects” for whom specific antagonists or inhibitors are not available or have been insufficiently studied as yet. These include IL-4, IL-13, TNF, chemokines (e.g., eotaxin, also known as CCL11), neuropeptides, nitric oxide, bradykinin, and endothelins.

It is thus clear that multiple mediators contribute to the acute asthmatic response. Moreover, the composition of this “mediator soup” likely varies among individuals or different types of asthma. The appreciation of the importance of inflammatory cells and mediators in asthma has led to greater emphasis on anti-inflammatory drugs, such as corticosteroids, in its treatment.
