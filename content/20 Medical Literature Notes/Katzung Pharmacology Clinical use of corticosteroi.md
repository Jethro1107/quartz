# Katzung Pharmacology: Clinical use of corticosteroids in asthma therapy

Created time: March 30, 2022 10:24 AM

### Summary:

Clinical studies show use of corticosteroids useful in asthma control

Systemic adverse effects limit use to urgent exacerbations, i.e. those not reversible with bronchodilators

ICS (inhaled corticosteroids) the most effective way to avoid systemic effects

****Clinical Uses****

Clinical studies of corticosteroids consistently show them to be effective in improving all indices of asthma control: severity of symptoms, tests of airway caliber and bronchial reactivity, frequency of exacerbations, and quality of life. Because of severe adverse effects when given chronically, oral and parenteral corticosteroids are reserved for patients who require urgent treatment, ie, those who have not improved adequately with bronchodilators or who experience worsening symptoms despite high-dose maintenance therapy.

For severe asthma exacerbations, urgent treatment is often begun with an oral dose of 30–60 mg [prednisone](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426873) per day or an intravenous dose of 0.5–1 mg/kg [methylprednisolone](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426777) every 6–12 hours; the dose is decreased after airway obstruction has improved. In most patients, systemic corticosteroid therapy can be discontinued in 5–10 days, but symptoms may worsen in other patients as the dose is decreased to lower levels.

Inhalational treatment is the most effective way to avoid the systemic adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy. The introduction of ICS such as **[beclomethasone](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=130854), [budesonide](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=423464), [ciclesonide](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=132256), [flunisolide](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=131288), [fluticasone](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=131304), [mometasone,](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=423555)** and **[triamcinolone](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=132056)** has made it possible to deliver corticosteroids to the airways with minimal systemic absorption. Indeed, one of the cautions in switching patients from chronic oral to ICS therapy is to taper oral therapy slowly to avoid precipitation of adrenal insufficiency. In patients requiring continued [prednisone](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426873) treatment despite standard doses of an ICS, higher inhaled doses are often effective and enable tapering and discontinuing [prednisone](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426873) treatment. Although these high doses of inhaled steroids may cause mild adrenal suppression, the risks of systemic toxicity from their chronic use are negligible compared with those of the oral corticosteroid therapy they replace.

A special problem caused by inhaled topical corticosteroids is the occurrence of oropharyngeal candidiasis and dysphonia (hoarseness). The candidiasis is easily treated with topical [clotrimazole](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=131047). The risk of these complications may be reduced by having patients gargle water and expectorate after each inhaled treatment, and use a spacer when applicable. [Ciclesonide](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=132256), a prodrug activated by bronchial esterases, is comparably effective to other inhaled corticosteroids and is associated with less frequent candidiasis. Hoarseness can also result from a direct local effect of ICS on the vocal cords. Although a majority of the inhaled dose is deposited in the oropharynx and swallowed, inhaled corticosteroids are subject to first-pass metabolism in the liver and thus are remarkably free of other short-term complications in adults. Nonetheless, chronic use may increase the risks of osteoporosis and cataracts. In children, ICS therapy has been shown to slow the rate of growth by about 1 cm over the first year of treatment, but not the rate of growth thereafter, so that the effect on adult height is minimal.

Because of the efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids, national and international guidelines for asthma management recommend their prescription for patients with persistent asthma who require more than occasional inhalations of a β agonist for relief of symptoms. This therapy is continued for 10–12 weeks and then withdrawn to determine whether more prolonged therapy is needed; inhaled corticosteroids are not curative. In most patients, the manifestations of asthma return within a few weeks after stopping therapy even if they have been taken in high doses for 2 or more years. A prospective, placebo-controlled study of the early, sustained use of inhaled corticosteroids in young children with asthma showed significantly greater improvement in asthma symptoms, pulmonary function, and frequency of asthma exacerbations over the 2 years of treatment, but no difference in overall asthma control 3 months after the end of the trial. Inhaled corticosteroids are thus properly labeled as “controllers.” They are effective only so long as they are taken.

Another approach to reducing the risk of long-term, twice-daily use of ICS is to administer them only intermittently, when symptoms of asthma flare. Taking a single inhalation of an ICS with each inhalation of a short-acting β-agonist reliever (eg, an inhalation of [beclomethasone](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=130854) for each inhalation of [albuterol](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426437)) or taking a 5- to 10-day course of twice-daily high-dose [budesonide](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=423464) or [beclomethasone](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=130854) when asthma symptoms worsen has been found to be nearly as effective as regular daily therapy in adults and children with mild to moderate asthma. Similarly, in adults and adolescents, as-needed use of a single combined inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta agonist (eg, budesonide-formoterol) is as effective for prevention of exacerbations and results in lower overall steroid exposure compared to twice-daily scheduled inhaled corticosteroids, but is inferior in regard to symptom control.
