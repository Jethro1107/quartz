# Robbins: Pathology of mitral valve prolapse (myxomatous mitral degeneration)

Created time: April 18, 2022 12:20 PM

**The characteristic anatomic change in MVP is ballooning (hooding) of the mitral leaflets** (  [Fig. 12.21A–C](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0110) ). The affected leaflets are often enlarged, redundant, thick, and rubbery. The associated tendinous cords may be elongated, thinned, or even ruptured, and the annulus may be dilated. The tricuspid, aortic, or pulmonary valves may also be affected. The key histologic change in the tissue is marked  **myxomatous degeneration** of the spongiosa layer, reflected by increased deposition of a highly sulfated hydrophilic matrix (see  [Fig. 12.21E](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0110) ); the collagenous fibrosa layer of the valve is also attenuated, affecting the structural integrity of the leaflet. Secondary changes reflect the stresses and tissue injury incident to the billowing leaflets: (1) fibrous thickening of the valve leaflets, particularly where they rub against each other; (2) linear fibrous thickening of the left ventricular endocardial surface where the abnormally long cords snap or rub against it; (3) thickening of the mural endocardium of the left ventricle or atrium as a consequence of friction-induced injury induced by the prolapsing, hypermobile leaflets; (4) thrombi on the atrial surfaces of the leaflets or the atrial walls (  [Fig. 12.21B](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0110) ); and (5) focal calcifications at the base of the posterior mitral leaflet (  [Fig. 12.21C](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0110) ). Notably, mitral valve myxomatous degeneration can also occur as a secondary consequence of regurgitation of other etiologies (e.g., ischemic dysfunction).

Note also mitral annular calcification on the left side  *(arrowhead).*  Normal heart valve (D) and myxomatous mitral valve (E). In myxomatous valves, collagen in the fibrosa layer is loose and disorganized, proteoglycan deposition  *(asterisk)*  in the central spongiosa layer is markedly expanded, and elastin in the atrialis layer is disorganized.(A, Courtesy William D. Edwards, MD, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn; D and E, Movat pentachrome stain, in which collagen is yellow, elastin is black, and proteoglycans are blue).
