## Steps Involved in Causing Hyperosmotic Renal Medullary Interstitium

Keeping in mind these characteristics of the loop of Henle, let us now discuss how the renal medulla becomes hyperosmotic ( Video 29-1 ). First, assume that the loop of Henle is filled with fluid having a concentration of 300 mOsm/L, the same as that leaving the proximal tubule ( [Figure 29-4](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0025) , step 1). Next, the active ion pump of the *thick ascending limb* on the loop of Henle reduces the concentration inside the tubule and raises the interstitial concentration; this pump establishes a 200-mOsm/L concentration gradient between the tubular fluid and interstitial fluid ( [Figure 29-4](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0025) , step 2). The limit to the gradient is about 200 mOsm/L because paracellular diffusion of ions back into the tubule eventually counterbalances the transport of ions out of the lumen when the 200-mOsm/L concentration gradient is achieved.

Step 3 is that the tubular fluid in the *descending limb of the loop of Henle* and interstitial fluid quickly reaches osmotic equilibrium due to osmosis of water out of the descending limb. The interstitial osmolarity is maintained at 400 mOsm/L because of continued transport of ions out of the thick ascending loop of Henle. Thus, by itself, active transport of sodium chloride out of the thick ascending limb is capable of establishing only a 200-mOsm/L concentration gradient, which is much less than that achieved by the countercurrent multiplier system.

Step 4 is the additional flow of fluid into the loop of Henle from the proximal tubule, which causes the hyperosmotic fluid previously formed in the descending limb to flow into the ascending limb. Once this fluid is in the ascending limb, additional ions are pumped into the interstitium and water remains in the tubular fluid until a 200-mOsm/L osmotic gradient is established, and the interstitial fluid osmolarity rises to 500 mOsm/L (step 5). Then, once again, fluid in the descending limb reaches equilibrium with the hyperosmotic medullary interstitial fluid (step 6) and, as the hyperosmotic tubular fluid from the descending limb of the loop of Henle flows into the ascending limb, still more solute is continuously pumped out of the tubules and deposited into the medullary interstitium.

These steps are repeated over and over, with the net effect of adding more and more solute to the medulla in excess of water. With sufficient time, *this process gradually traps solutes in the medulla and multiplies the concentration gradient established by the active pumping of ions out of the thick ascending loop of Henle* , *eventually raising the interstitial fluid osmolarity to 1200 to 1400 mOsm/L, as shown in step 7* .

Thus, the repetitive reabsorption of sodium chloride by the thick ascending loop of Henle and continued inflow of new sodium chloride from the proximal tubule into the loop of Henle is called the *countercurrent multiplier* . The sodium chloride reabsorbed from the ascending loop of Henle keeps adding to the newly arrived sodium chloride, thus “multiplying” its concentration in the medullary interstitium.
