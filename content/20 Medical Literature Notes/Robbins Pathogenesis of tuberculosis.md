## Pathogenesis

**The outcome of infection in a previously unexposed, immunocompetent person depends on the development of antimycobacterial T cell–mediated immunity.** These T cells control the host response to the bacteria and also result in development of pathologic lesions, such as caseating granulomas and cavitation.

**Infection by *M. tuberculosis* proceeds in steps, from initial infection of macrophages to a subsequent Th1 response that both contains the bacteria and causes tissue damage** ( [Fig. 8.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ). Early in infection, *M. tuberculosis* replicates essentially unchecked within macrophages, and later in infection, the cell response stimulates macrophages to contain the proliferation of the bacteria. The steps in infection are as follows:

*Entry into macrophages. M. tuberculosis* enters macrophages by phagocytosis mediated by several receptors expressed on the phagocyte, including mannose-binding lectin and the type 3 complement receptor (CR3).

*Replication in macrophages. M. tuberculosis* inhibits maturation of the phagosome and blocks formation of the phagolysosome, allowing the bacterium to replicate unchecked within the vesicle, protected from the microbicidal mechanisms of lysosomes. The bacterium blocks phagolysosome formation by recruiting a host protein called coronin to the membrane of the phagosome. Coronin activates the phosphatase calcineurin, leading to inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion. Thus, during the earliest stage of primary tuberculosis (<3 weeks) in the nonsensitized individual, bacteria proliferate in the pulmonary alveolar macrophages and air spaces, resulting in bacteremia and seeding of multiple sites. Despite the bacteremia, most people at this stage are asymptomatic or have a mild flulike illness.

*Innate immunity.* Multiple pathogen associated molecular patterns ( [Chapter 6](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323531139000066?scrollTo=%23c00006) ) made by *M. tuberculosis* are recognized by innate immune receptors. Mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan binds TLR2, and unmethylated CpG nucleotides bind TLR9. These interactions initiate and enhance the innate and adaptive immune responses to *M* . *tuberculosis* , as described below.

*The Th1 response.* About 3 weeks after infection, a Th1 response is mounted that activates macrophages, enabling them to become bactericidal. The response is initiated by mycobacterial antigens that enter draining lymph nodes and are displayed to T cells. Differentiation of Th1 cells depends on IL-12 and IL-18, which are produced by antigen-presenting cells that have encountered the mycobacteria. Stimulation of TLR2 by mycobacterial ligands promotes production of IL-12 by dendritic cells.

*Th1-mediated macrophage activation and killing of bacteria.* Th1 cells, both in lymph nodes and in the lung, produce IFN-γ. IFN-γ is the critical mediator that activates macrophages and enables them to contain the *M. tuberculosis* infection. First, IFN-γ stimulates maturation of the phagolysosome in infected macrophages, exposing the bacteria to a lethal acidic, oxidizing environment. Second, IFN-γ stimulates expression of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase, which produces NO. NO combines with other oxidants to create reactive nitrogen intermediates, which are important for killing of mycobacteria. Third, IFN-γ mobilizes antimicrobial peptides (defensins) against the bacteria. Finally, IFN-γ stimulates autophagy, a process that sequesters and then destroys damaged organelles and intracellular bacteria such as *M. tuberculosis* .

*Granulomatous inflammation and tissue damage.* In addition to stimulating macrophages to kill mycobacteria, the Th1 response orchestrates the formation of granulomas and caseous necrosis. Macrophages activated by IFN-γ differentiate into the “epithelioid histiocytes” that aggregate to form granulomas; some epithelioid cells may fuse to form giant cells. In many people this response halts the infection before significant tissue destruction or illness occur. In other people the infection progresses due to advanced age or immunosuppression, and the ongoing immune response results in caseous necrosis. Activated macrophages also secrete TNF and chemokines, which promote recruitment of more monocytes. The importance of TNF is underscored by the fact that patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are treated with a TNF antagonist have an increased risk of tuberculosis reactivation.

*Host susceptibility to disease.* AIDS is the greatest risk factor for progression to active disease, due to the loss of immunologic control of the organism. Other forms of immunosuppression, including glucocorticoids, TNF inhibitors, and transplants (solid organ and stem cell) also carry increased risk, as do renal failure and malnutrition. Rare inherited mutations that interfere with the Th1 response, such as loss of the IL-12 receptor β1 protein, result in increased susceptibility to severe tuberculosis and even symptomatic infection with normally avirulent (so-called “atypical”) mycobacteria, such as the *Mycobacterium avium complex* (MAC), discussed later, or with the attenuated BCG vaccine strain. As previously mentioned, this group of genetic disorders is called *Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease.*
