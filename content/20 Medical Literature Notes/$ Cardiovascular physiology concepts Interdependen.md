Previous discussion focused on the independent effects of preload, afterload, and inotropy on ventricular function; however, it is important to understand that these determinants of ventricular function are also interdependent. For example, a change in preload leads to secondary changes in afterload that can alter the initial response to the change in preload. Furthermore, a change in afterload leads to changes in preload, and a change in inotropy can alter both preload and afterload.

Let us first consider how ventricular responses to a change in preload can be modified by secondary changes in afterload. An increase in venous return increases ventricular filling (EDV; preload) (Fig. 4-23, panel A, red loop). The new steady-state loop shows that EDV increases along with a smaller increase in ESV. ESV increases because afterload increases owing to increased wall stress (see Equation 4-2) caused by increased ventricular radius (increased EDV) and increased ventricular systolic pressure resulting from an increase in SV and cardiac output. But the increase in EDV is greater than the increase in ESV; therefore, despite the secondary increase in afterload, the SV (width of pressure–volume loop) remains elevated. This differs from Figure 4-11 in which only the independent effect of increased preload is shown while afterload is held constant.

An increase in afterload, as previously discussed, leads to a decrease in SV and an increase in ESV as shown in Figure 4-23 (panel B, red loop). However, because the ESV is increased, the increased afterload leads to a small increase in preload. The increased ESV inside the ventricle is added to the venous return, thereby increasing EDV. After several beats, a steady state is achieved in which the increase in ESV is greater than the secondary increase in EDV so that the difference between the two is decreased. This increase in preload secondary to an increase in afterload activates the Frank-Starling mechanism, which partially compensates for the reduction in SV caused by the initial increase in afterload (see Fig. 4-15).

The direct, independent effects of an increase inotropy are an increase in SV and a decrease in ESV (Fig. 4-23, panel C, red loop). However, the increased SV increases cardiac output, arterial pressure, and ventricular systolic pressure, which increases afterload on the ventricle. Increased afterload tends to increase ESV, which partially offsets the effects of increased inotropy on ESV. With a decrease in ESV, less blood remains in the ventricle that can be added to the venous return, so the EDV becomes smaller, although this will be partially offset by the tendency of the increased afterload to increase EDV. After a new steady state is reached following the increase in inotropy, the net effect of these changes is an increase in SV, which is accompanied by a reduction in ESV and a smaller reduction in EDV.

The interactions between preload, afterload, and inotropy can also be visualized using Frank-Starling curves (Fig. 4-24). In this figure, the left ventricle under control conditions has a SV of 60 mL at an end-diastolic pressure (index of preload) of about 8 mm Hg. Decreasing the afterload or increasing the inotropy causes an upward shift in the Frank-Starling curve. The heart responds by increasing the SV while, at the same time, decreasing the end-diastolic pressure (i.e., there is a diagonal shift in the operating point between the curves). With an increase in afterload or a decrease in inotropy, the Frank-Starling curves shifts downward, leading to a fall in SV and a secondary increase in EDV.

These interactions between changes in preload, afterload, and inotropy will be discussed further in [Chapter 9](https://meded-lwwhealthlibrary-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?legacySectionId=klabunde3-klabunde-3-klabunde-ch009) in the context of cardiac disorders such as heart failure and valve disease.
