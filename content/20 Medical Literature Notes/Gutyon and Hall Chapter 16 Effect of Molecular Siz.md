## Effect of Molecular Size on Passage Through the Pores

The width of the capillary intercellular cleft pores, 6 to 7 nanometers, is about 20 times the diameter of the water molecule, which is the smallest molecule that normally passes through the capillary pores. The diameters of plasma protein molecules, however, are slightly greater than the width of the pores. Other substances, such as sodium ions, chloride ions, glucose, and urea, have intermediate diameters. Therefore, the permeability of the capillary pores for different substances varies according to their molecular diameters.

[Table 16-1](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/t0010) lists the relative permeabilities of the capillary pores in skeletal muscle for various substances, demonstrating, for example, that the permeability for glucose molecules is 0.6 times that for water molecules, whereas the permeability for albumin molecules is very slight—only one 1/1000 that for water molecules.

A word of caution must be stated at this point. The capillaries in various tissues have extreme differences in their permeabilities. For example, the membranes of the liver capillary sinusoids are so permeable that even plasma proteins pass through these walls, almost as easily as water and other substances. Also, the permeability of the renal glomerular membrane for water and electrolytes is about 500 times the permeability of the muscle capillaries, but this is not true for the plasma proteins. For these proteins, the capillary permeabilities are very slight, as in other tissues and organs. When we study these different organs later in this text, it should become clear why some tissues require greater degrees of capillary permeability than other tissues. For example, greater degrees of capillary permeability are required for the liver to transfer tremendous amounts of nutrients between the blood and liver parenchymal cells and for the kidneys to allow filtration of large quantities of fluid for the formation of urine.
