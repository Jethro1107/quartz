## **Margins and borders** **of the heart**

Some general descriptions of cardiac orientation refer to right, left, inferior (acute), and obtuse margins:

▪ The right and left margins are the same as the right and left pulmonary surfaces of the heart.
▪ The inferior margin is defined as the sharp edge between the anterior and diaphragmatic surfaces of the heart ( Figs 3.63 and 3.65 )—it is formed mostly by the right ventricle and a small portion of the left ventricle near the apex.
▪ The obtuse margin separates the anterior and left pulmonary surfaces ( Fig. 3.63 )—it is round and extends from the left auricle to the cardiac apex ( Fig. 3.65 ), and is formed mostly by the left ventricle and superiorly by a small portion of the left auricle.

For radiological evaluations, a thorough understanding of the structures defining the cardiac borders is critical. The right border in a standard posteroanterior view consists of the superior vena cava, the right atrium, and the inferior vena cava ( Fig. 3.67A ). The left border in a similar view consists of the arch of the aorta, the pulmonary trunk, left auricle, and the left ventricle. The inferior border in this radiological study consists of the right ventricle and the left ventricle at the apex. In lateral views, the right ventricle is seen anteriorly, and the left atrium is visualized posteriorly ( Fig. 3.67B ).
