## Angiotensin II Increases Sodium and Water Reabsorption

Angiotensin II is perhaps the body’s most powerful sodium-retaining hormone. As discussed in [Chapter 19](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000199) , angiotensin II formation increases in circumstances associated with low blood pressure and/or low extracellular fluid volume, such as during hemorrhage or loss of salt and water from the body fluids by excessive sweating or severe diarrhea. Increased formation of angiotensin II helps return blood pressure and extracellular volume toward normal by increasing sodium and water reabsorption from the renal tubules through three main effects:

- *Angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone secretion* , which in turn increases sodium reabsorption.
- *Angiotensin II constricts the efferent arterioles,* which has two effects on peritubular capillary dynamics that increase sodium and water reabsorption. First, efferent arteriolar constriction reduces peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressure, which increases net tubular reabsorption, especially from the proximal tubules. Second, efferent arteriolar constriction, by reducing renal blood flow, raises filtration fraction in the glomerulus and increases the concentration of proteins and colloid osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries. This mechanism also increases the reabsorptive force at the peritubular capillaries and raises tubular reabsorption of sodium and water.
- *Angiotensin II directly stimulates sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubules, the loops of Henle, the distal tubules, and the collecting tubules.* One of the direct effects of angiotensin II is to stimulate the Na + -K + ATPase pump on the tubular epithelial cell basolateral membrane. A second effect is to stimulate sodium-hydrogen exchange in the luminal membrane, especially in the proximal tubule. A third effect of angiotensin II is to stimulate sodium-bicarbonate co-transport in the basolateral membrane ( [Figure 28-18](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0095) ).

Direct effects of angiotensin II ( *Ang II* ) to increase proximal tubular sodium reabsorption. Ang II stimulates sodium-hydrogen exchange ( *NHE* ) on the luminal membrane and Na + -K + ATPase transporter as well as sodium-bicarbonate co-transport on the basolateral membrane. These same effects of Ang II likely occur in several other parts of the renal tubule, including the loop of Henle, distal tubule, and collecting tubule. AT 1 , Angiotensin II type I receptor.

Thus, angiotensin II stimulates sodium transport across both the luminal and basolateral surfaces of the epithelial cell membrane in most renal tubular segments. These multiple actions of angiotensin II cause marked sodium and water retention by the kidneys when angiotensin II levels are increased and play a critical role in permitting the body to adapt to wide variations in sodium intake without large changes in extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure, as discussed in [Chapter 30](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323597128000308) .

At the same time that angiotensin II increases renal tubular sodium reabsorption, its vasoconstrictor effect on efferent arterioles also aids in the maintenance of normal excretion of metabolic waste products such as urea and creatinine that depend mainly on an adequate GFR for their excretion. Thus, increased formation of angiotensin II permits the kidneys to retain sodium and water without causing retention of metabolic waste products.
