## Apoptosis

**Apoptosis is a pathway of cell death in which cells activate enzymes that degrade the cells' own nuclear DNA and nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins** ( [Fig. 2.11](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0060) ). Fragments of the apoptotic cells then break off, giving the appearance that is responsible for the name ( *apoptosis* , “falling off”). The plasma membrane of the apoptotic cell remains intact, but the membrane is altered in such a way that the fragments, called apoptotic bodies, become highly “edible,” leading to their rapid consumption by phagocytes. The dead cell and its fragments are cleared with little leakage of cellular contents, so apoptotic cell death does not elicit an inflammatory reaction. Thus, apoptosis differs in many respects from necrosis ( [Table 2.1](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/t0010) ).
