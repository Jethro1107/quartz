**DIPSTICKS**

**Indications and use** — Dipsticks to evaluate for urine leukocyte esterase and nitrite can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of UTI. Dipsticks are generally performed whenever UTI is suspected. However, we do not routinely collect urine for dipstick in young nonpregnant females with a history clearly suggestive of a UTI (ie, typical symptoms without vaginal discharge or irritation), as the dipstick generally does not provide additional useful information [[7-9](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/7-9)]. The use of dipsticks for the diagnosis of UTI is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ["Acute simple cystitis in women", section on 'Diagnostic approach'](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/acute-simple-cystitis-in-women?sectionName=DIAGNOSTIC+APPROACH&search=microbial+diagnosis+of+urinary+tract+infections&topicRef=8056&anchor=H899949177&source=see_link#H899949177) and ["Acute simple cystitis in men", section on 'Diagnostic approach'](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/acute-simple-cystitis-in-men?sectionName=DIAGNOSTIC+APPROACH&search=microbial+diagnosis+of+urinary+tract+infections&topicRef=8056&anchor=H12809397&source=see_link#H12809397) and ["Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults", section on 'Diagnostic approach'](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults?sectionName=DIAGNOSTIC+APPROACH&search=microbial+diagnosis+of+urinary+tract+infections&topicRef=8056&anchor=H12414281&source=see_link#H12414281).)

In general, dipsticks to evaluate for leukocyte esterase and nitrite should not be performed in patients without any symptoms consistent with a UTI, as a positive dipstick, which would denote the presence of pyuria and/or bacteriuria, does not indicate a UTI in an asymptomatic patient. The rationale for this is similar to the reasons not to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria, which are discussed in detail elsewhere [[10](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/10)]. (See ["Asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults"](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults?search=microbial+diagnosis+of+urinary+tract+infections&topicRef=8056&source=see_link).)

**Accuracy** — Dipsticks detect the presence of leukocyte esterase and nitrite in the urine.

- Leukocyte esterase corresponds to pyuria. Leukocyte esterase may be used to detect >10 leukocytes per high power field (sensitivity of 75 to 96 percent; specificity of 94 to 98 percent) [[11](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/11)].
- A positive nitrite test is a reliable index of significant bacteriuria, although a negative test does not exclude bacteriuria. Normally no detectable nitrite is present.

The majority of bacteria that cause UTIs (*E. coli, Proteus mirabilis*, and *Klebsiella)* produce nitrate reductase, an enzyme that transforms urine nitrate, a metabolite of alimentary origin, into nitrite that is detected by dipsticks. When bacteriuria with one of these organisms is significant, the test is positive in about 80 percent of cases in which the urine has incubated for at least four hours in the bladder [[12](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/12)]. Other potential urinary pathogens (*Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas,* Group B *Streptococcus, Acinetobacter*, *Enterococcus faecalis,* and fungi) do not produce a nitrate reductase, and thus the nitrite test is not positive in infections caused by these organisms.

Other possible causes for a negative nitrite test despite the bacteriuria include early phase of infection, insufficient bladder incubation time for conversion of nitrate to nitrite, low urinary excretion of nitrate, decreased urine pH (due to cranberry juice, vitamin C, or other dietary supplements), high (>5 g/L) glycosuria, high urine specific gravity (>1.02) and proteinuria >1 g/L [[13,14](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/13,14)]. False-positive nitrite tests can occur with substances that turn the urine red, such as the bladder analgesic [phenazopyridine](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/phenazopyridine-drug-information?search=microbial+diagnosis+of+urinary+tract+infections&topicRef=8056&source=see_link) or the ingestion of beets. (See ["Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease", section on 'Red to brown urine'](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease?sectionName=Red+to+brown+urine&search=microbial+diagnosis+of+urinary+tract+infections&topicRef=8056&anchor=H2641063697&source=see_link#H2641063697).)

Most studies have supported the diagnostic value of the nitrite and leukocyte esterase results, particularly when they are concordant [[15,16](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/15,16)]. A meta-analysis including 70 publications concluded that the urine dipstick test alone is useful when both nitrite and leukocyte esterase tests are positive (sensitivity 68 to 88 percent) [[15](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/15)].

The diagnostic value of dipstick testing has been evaluated in both primary care and emergency settings. In a review of six studies that included females aged 17 to 70 with suspected UTI in primary care settings, positive dipstick findings (nitrite or leukocyte esterase and blood) had sensitivity and specificity of 75 and 66 percent, respectively [[17](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/17)]. In a systematic review of four studies that evaluated the utility of dipstick results in addition to history and physical examination findings in diagnosing acute UTI in symptomatic females presenting to the emergency room, a negative dipstick urinalysis accurately ruled out the diagnosis of UTI (as confirmed by urine culture) when the pretest probability was low [[18](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/18)]. Across the studies, which included 948 females, the prevalence of UTI ranged from 40 to 60 percent and only a positive nitrite reaction was useful to rule in a UTI and only a negative leukocyte esterase or blood reaction were accurate in ruling out a UTI.

However, other studies have suggested that dipstick results are of lower clinical utility. In one study, 434 adult females with suspected lower UTI in a primary care setting were assessed; sixty-six patients had confirmed UTI. The presence of nitrite, leukocyte esterase, and blood on the dipstick as well as clinical criteria (urine cloudiness, dysuria, and nocturia) were evaluated for diagnostic value. The negative predictive value was 67 percent for the absence of all features, and the positive value was 82 percent for the presence of three features. The authors concluded that dipstick results can modestly improve diagnosis, but cannot adequately rule out infection [[19](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/19)]. Similarly, in a study of 2252 females with overactive bladder, dipstick test was not sufficient to identify patients with UTI (sensitivity and specificity 44 and 86 percent, respectively) [[20](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/20)].
