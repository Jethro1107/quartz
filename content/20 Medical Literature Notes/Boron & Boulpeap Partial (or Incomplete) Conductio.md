# Boron & Boulpeap: Partial (or Incomplete) Conduction Block

Created time: March 17, 2022 4:53 PM

Three major types of partial conduction block exist: slowed conduction, intermittent block, and unidirectional block. We defer the discussion of unidirectional block until we consider re-entry phenomena. In slowed conduction, the tissue conducts all the impulses, but more slowly than normal. First-degree AV block reflects a slowing of conduction through the AV node. On an ECG, first-degree AV block appears as an unusually long PR interval (compare A and B in Fig. 21-14 ). Figure 21-14

Pathological ECGs. In E, right bundle branch block is visible in the V 1 or V 2 precordial leads; left bundle branch block is visible in the V 5 or V 6 leads. (Modified from Chernoff HM: Workbook in Clinical Electrocardiography. New York, Medcom, 1972.) A second example of partial conduction block is intermittent block, in which the tissue conducts some impulses but not others. In the AV node, intermittent block leads to second-degree AV block, of which there are two types. Both reflect incomplete (i.e., intermittent) coupling of the atria to the ventricles. In a Mobitz type I block (or Wenckebach block), the PR interval gradually lengthens from one cycle to the next until the AV node fails completely, skipping a ventricular depolarization (see Fig. 21-14 C ). With Mobitz type I block, it is most common to see every third or fourth atrial beat fail to conduct to the ventricles. In a Mobitz type II block, the PR interval is constant from beat to beat, but every nth ventricular depolarization is missing. In Figure 21-14 D , the first cardiac cycle is normal. However, the second P wave is not followed by a QRS or T. Instead, the ECG record is flat until the third P wave arrives at the expected time, followed by a QRS and a T. Thus, we say that every second QRS is dropped (2:1 block).

Another form of intermittent conduction block, called rate-dependent block, reflects disease often seen in the large branches of the His-Purkinje fiber system (i.e., the bundle branches). When the heart rate exceeds a critical level, the ventricular conduction system fails, presumably because a part of the conducting system lacks sufficient time to repolarize. With intermittent failure of the His-Purkinje fiber system, the impulse is left to spread slowly and inefficiently through the ventricles by conducting from one myocyte to the next. Such a failure, whether intermittent or continuous, is known as a bundle branch block and appears on the ECG as an intermittently wide QRS complex (see Fig. 21-14 E ). Because this block impairs the coordinated spread of the action potential throughout the ventricles, the resulting contraction loses some efficiency.
