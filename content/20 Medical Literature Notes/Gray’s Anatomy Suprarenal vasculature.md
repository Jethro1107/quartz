## Suprarenal vasculature

The arterial supply to the suprarenal glands is extensive and arises from three primary sources (  [Fig. 4.163](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0750) ):

- As the bilateral inferior phrenic arteries pass upward from the abdominal aorta to the diaphragm, they give off multiple branches (superior suprarenal arteries) to the suprarenal glands.
- A middle branch (middle suprarenal artery) to the suprarenal glands usually arises directly from the abdominal aorta.
- Inferior branches (inferior suprarenal arteries) from the renal arteries pass upward to the suprarenal glands.

In contrast to this multiple arterial supply is the venous drainage, which usually consists of a single vein leaving the hilum of each gland. On the right side, the  **right suprarenal vein** is short and almost immediately enters the inferior vena cava, while on the left side, the  **left suprarenal vein** passes inferiorly to enter the left renal vein.
