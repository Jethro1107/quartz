- The Ventilation-Perfusion Ratio
    - So far, we have considered three of the four causes of hypoxemia: hypoventilation, diffusion, and shunt. We now come to the last cause, which is both the most common and the most difficult to understand, namely, ventilation-perfusion inequality.
    - A critical factor in maintaining efficient gas exchange and preventing hypoxemia is ensuring that lung units receive a balanced mix of ventilation and perfusion; if ventilation and blood flow are mismatched in various regions of the lung, impaired transfer of both O2 and CO2 results. The key to understanding how this happens is the ventilation-perfusion ratio. Consider a model of a lung unit (Figure 2.1) in which the uptake of O2 is being mimicked using dye and water (Figure 5.6). Powdered dye is continuously poured into the unit to represent the addition of O2 by alveolar ventilation. Water is pumped continuously through the unit to represent the blood flow that removes the O2. A stirrer mixes the alveolar contents, a process normally accomplished by gaseous diffusion. The key question is: What determines the concentration of dye (or O2) in the alveolar compartment and, therefore, in the effluent water (or blood)?

    - Model to illustrate how the ventilation-perfusion ratio determines the Po2 in a lung unit.
    Powdered dye is added by ventilation at the rate V and removed by blood flow Q to represent the factors controlling alveolar Po2. The concentration of dye is given by V/Q.

    - It is clear that both the rate at which the dye is added (ventilation) and the rate at which water is pumped (blood flow) will affect the concentration of dye in the model. What may not be intuitively clear is that the concentration of dye is determined by the ratio of these rates. In other words, if dye is added at the rate of V g·min−1 and water is pumped through at Q liters·min−1, the concentration of dye in the alveolar compartment and effluent water is V/Q g·liter−1.
    In exactly the same way, the concentration of O2 (or, better, Po2) in any lung unit is determined by the ratio of ventilation to blood flow. This is true not only for O2 but also for CO2, N2, and any other gas that is present under steady-state conditions. This is why the ventilation-perfusion ratio plays such a key role in pulmonary gas exchange.
