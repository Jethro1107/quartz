# Boron & Boulpaep: Complete conduction block

In complete block, or third-degree AV block, no impulses conduct through the affected area, in either direction. For example, complete block at the AV node stops any supraventricular electrical impulse from triggering a ventricular contraction. Thus, AV nodal block electrically severs the atria and ventricles, each of which beats under control of its own pacemakers. This situation is called AV dissociation. The only ventricular pacemakers that are available to initiate cardiac contraction are the Purkinje fiber cells, which are notoriously unreliable and slow. Thus, cardiac output may fall, and blood pressure along with it. AV dissociation can therefore constitute a medical emergency, and placement of an artificial ventricular pacemaker can prove lifesaving. On an ECG, complete block appears as regularly spaced P waves (i.e., the SA node properly triggers the atria) and as irregularly spaced QRS and T waves that have a low frequency and no fixed relationship to the P waves (see Fig. 21-14 F ).
