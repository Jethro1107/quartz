## Tubuloglomerular Feedback and Autoregulation of Glomerular Filtration Rate

The kidneys have a special feedback mechanism that links changes in the sodium chloride concentration at the macula densa with the control of renal arteriolar resistance and autoregulation of GFR. This feedback helps ensure a relatively constant delivery of sodium chloride to the distal tubule and helps prevent spurious fluctuations in renal excretion that would otherwise occur. In many circumstances, this feedback autoregulates renal blood flow and GFR in parallel. However, because this mechanism is specifically directed toward stabilizing sodium chloride delivery to the distal tubule, instances occur when GFR is autoregulated at the expense of changes in renal blood flow, as discussed later. In other cases, this mechanism may actually cause changes in GFR in response to primary changes in renal tubular sodium chloride reabsorption.

The tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism has two components that act together to control GFR: (1) an afferent arteriolar feedback mechanism; and (2) an efferent arteriolar feedback mechanism. These feedback mechanisms depend on special anatomical arrangements of the *juxtaglomerular complex* ( [Figure 27-10](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0055) ).

The juxtaglomerular complex consists of *macula densa cells* in the initial portion of the distal tubule and *juxtaglomerular cells* in the walls of the afferent and efferent arterioles. The macula densa is a specialized group of epithelial cells in the distal tubules that comes in close contact with the afferent and efferent arterioles. The macula densa cells contain the Golgi apparatus, which consists of intracellular secretory organelles directed toward the arterioles, suggesting that these cells may be secreting a substance toward the arterioles.

## Decreased Macula Densa Sodium Chloride Causes Dilation of Afferent Arterioles and Increased Renin Release

The macula densa cells sense changes in sodium chloride delivery to the distal tubule by way of signals that are not completely understood. Experimental studies have suggested that a decreased GFR slows the flow rate in the loop of Henle, causing increased reabsorption of the percentage of sodium and chloride ions delivered to the ascending loop of Henle and thereby reducing the concentration of sodium chloride at the macula densa cells. This decrease in sodium chloride concentration initiates a signal from the macula densa that has two effects ( [Figure 27-11](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0060) ): (1) it decreases resistance to blood flow in the afferent arterioles, which raises glomerular hydrostatic pressure and helps return GFR toward normal; and (2) it increases renin release from the juxtaglomerular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles, which are the major storage sites for renin. Renin released from these cells then functions as an enzyme to increase the formation of angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II. Finally, angiotensin II constricts the efferent arterioles, thereby increasing glomerular hydrostatic pressure and helping return GFR toward normal.

These two components of the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism, operating together by way of the special anatomical structure of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, provide feedback signals to the afferent and efferent arterioles for efficient autoregulation of GFR during changes in arterial pressure. When both of these mechanisms are functioning together, GFR changes by only a few percentage points, even with large fluctuations in arterial pressure between the limits of 75 and 160 mm Hg.

## Blockade of Angiotensin II Formation Further Reduces Glomerular Filtration Rate During Renal Hypoperfusion

As discussed earlier, a preferential constrictor action of angiotensin II on efferent arterioles helps prevent serious reductions in glomerular hydrostatic pressure and GFR when renal perfusion pressure falls below normal. The administration of drugs that block the formation of angiotensin II (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) or that block the action of angiotensin II (angiotensin II receptor antagonists) may cause greater reductions in GFR than usual when the renal arterial pressure falls below normal. Therefore, an important complication of using these drugs to treat patients who have hypertension because of renal artery stenosis (partial blockage of the renal artery) is a severe decrease in GFR that can, in some cases, cause acute renal failure. Nevertheless, angiotensin II–blocking drugs are important therapeutic agents in many patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and other conditions, as long as the patients are monitored to ensure that severe decreases in GFR do not occur.
