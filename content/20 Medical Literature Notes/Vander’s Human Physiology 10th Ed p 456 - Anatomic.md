*Dead Space*

The conducting airways have a volume of about 150 ml. Exchanges of gases with the blood occur only in the alveoli and not in this 150 ml of the airways. Picture, then, what occurs during expiration of a tidal volume of 500 ml. The 500 ml of air is forced out of the alveoli and through the airways. Approximately 350 ml of this alveolar air is exhaled at the nose or mouth, but approximately 150 ml remains in the airways at the end of expiration. During the **next inspiration** (**Figure 13–19**), 500 ml of air flows into the alveoli, but the first 150 ml entering the alveoli is not atmospheric air but the 150 ml left behind in the airways from the last breath. Thus, only 350 ml of new atmospheric air enters the alveoli during the inspiration. The end result is that 150 ml of the 500 ml of atmospheric air entering the respiratory system during each inspiration never reaches the alveoli, but is merely moved in and out of the airways. Because these airways do not permit gas exchange with the blood, the space within them is termed the **anatomic dead space (*V*D).**

Thus the volume of *fresh* air entering the alveoli during each inspiration equals the tidal volume *minus* the volume of air in the anatomic dead space. For the previous example:

Tidal volume (*V*t) = 500 ml

Anatomic dead space (*V*D) = 150 ml

Fresh air entering alveoli in one inspiration (*V*A) =
500 ml – 150 ml = 350 ml

The total volume of fresh air entering the alveoli per minute is called the **alveolar ventilation (*V* ̇A):**

Alveolar ventilation rather than minute ventilation, is the more important factor in the effectiveness of gas exchange. This generalization is demonstrated readily by the data in **Table 13–5**. In this experiment, subject A breathes rapidly and shallowly, B normally, and C slowly and deeply. Each subject has exactly the same minute ventilation; that is, each is moving the same amount of air in and out of the lungs per minute. Yet, when we subtract the anatomic dead-space ventilation from the minute ventilation, we find marked differences in alveolar ventilation. Subject A has no alveolar ventilation and would become unconscious in several minutes, whereas C has a considerably greater alveolar ventilation than B, who is breathing normally.

Another important generalization drawn from this example is that increased *depth* of breathing is far more effective in elevating alveolar ventilation than an equivalent increase in breathing *rate.* Conversely, a decrease in depth can lead to a critical reduction in alveolar ventilation. This is because a fixed volume of each tidal volume goes to the dead space. If the tidal volume decreases, the fraction of the tidal volume going to the dead space increases until, as in subject A, it may represent the entire tidal volume. On the other hand, any increase in tidal volume goes entirely toward increasing alveolar ventilation. These concepts have important physiological implications. Most situations that produce an increased ventilation, such as exercise, reflexly call forth a relatively greater increase in breathing depth than in breathing rate.
