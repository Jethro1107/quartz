## Non-Atopic Asthma

Individuals with non-atopic asthma do not have evidence of allergen sensitization, and skin test results are usually negative. A positive family history of asthma is less common in these patients. Respiratory infections due to viruses (e.g., rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus) are common triggers in non-atopic asthma. Inhaled air pollutants such as tobacco smoke, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide may also contribute to the chronic airway inflammation and hyperreactivity in some cases. As already mentioned, in some instances attacks may be triggered by seemingly innocuous events, such as exposure to cold and even exercise.

## Drug-Induced Asthma

Several pharmacologic agents provoke asthma. Aspirin-sensitive asthma is an uncommon type, occurring in individuals with recurrent rhinitis and nasal polyps. These individuals are exquisitely sensitive to small doses of aspirin as well as other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and they experience not only asthmatic attacks but also urticaria. Aspirin and related drugs trigger asthma in these patients by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, leading to a rapid decrease in prostaglandin E 2 . Normally prostaglandin E 2 inhibits enzymes that generate proinflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes B 4 , C 4 , D 4 , and E 4 , which are believed to have central roles in aspirin-induced asthma.

## Occupational Asthma

This form of asthma may be triggered by fumes (epoxy resins, plastics), organic and chemical dusts (wood, cotton, platinum), gases (toluene), or other chemicals (formaldehyde, penicillin products). Only minute quantities of chemicals are required to induce the attack, which usually occurs after repeated exposure. The underlying mechanisms vary according to stimulus and include type I reactions, direct liberation of bronchoconstrictor substances, and hypersensitivity responses of unknown origin.
