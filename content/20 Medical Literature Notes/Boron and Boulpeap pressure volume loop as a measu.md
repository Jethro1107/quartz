# Boron and Boulpeap: pressure volume loop as a measure of ejection work of the ventricle

Created time: March 30, 2022 4:19 PM

In Figure 22-1 , we saw separate plots of ventricular pressure against time and volume against time. If, at each point in time, we now plot pressure against volume, the result is a pressure-volume loop, as is shown in Figure 22-9 for the left ventricle. This loop is a “phase plot” that describes the relationship between left ventricular pressure and left ventricular volume during the cardiac cycle. Notice that, although time does not explicitly appear in this plot, as we make one complete counterclockwise cycle around the loop, we sequentially plot pressure and volume at all time points of the cardiac cycle. However, the distance between two points on the loop is not proportional to elapsed time.

Pressure-volume loop of the left ventricle.
In examining this pressure-volume loop, we will arbitrarily start at point A in Figure 22-9 , and then consider each of the segments of the loop (e.g., AB, BC, and so on) before again returning to point A. Although we use the left ventricle as an example, a similar analysis applies to the right ventricle.

Segment AB
Point A in Figure 22-9 represents the instant at which the mitral valve opens. At this point, left ventricular volume is at its minimal value of ~50 mL, and left ventricular pressure is at the fairly low value of ~7 mm Hg. As the mitral valve opens, the ventricle begins to fill passively, because atrial pressure is higher than ventricular pressure. During interval AB, ventricular pressure falls slightly to ~5 mm Hg because the ventricular muscle is continuing to relax during diastole. Thus, despite the rapid entry of blood, ventricular pressure falls to its lowest value in the cardiac cycle.

Segment BC
During a second phase of ventricular filling, volume rises markedly from ~70 to ~120 mL, accompanied by a rather modest increase in pressure from ~5 to ~10 mm Hg. The modest rise in pressure, despite a doubling of ventricular volume Δ V , reflects the high compliance ( C = Δ V /Δ P ) of the ventricular wall during late diastole. The relationship between pressure and volume during segment BC is similar to that in blood vessels (see p. 454 ).

Segment CD
Point C in Figure 22-9 represents the closure of the mitral valve. At this point, ventricular filling has ended and isovolumetric contraction —represented by the vertical line CD—is about to begin. Thus, by the definition of isovolumetric, ventricular volume remains at 120 mL while left ventricular pressure rises to ~80 mm Hg, about equal to the aortic end-diastolic pressure.

Segment DE
Point D in Figure 22-9 represents the opening of the aortic valve. With the outlet to the aorta now open, the ventricular muscle can begin to shorten and to eject blood. During this period of rapid ejection, ventricular volume decreases from ~120 to ~75 mL. Notice that as contraction continues during interval DE, the ventricular pressure rises even farther, reaching a peak systolic value of ~130 mm Hg at point E.

Segment EF
Point E in Figure 22-9 represents the instant at which the ventricular muscle starts to relax. During this period of decreased ejection, ventricular pressure falls from ~130 to ~100 mm Hg. Nevertheless, blood continues to leave the ventricle, and ventricular volume falls from ~75 mL at point E to ~50 mL at point F. Point F represents end-systolic volume and pressure. Notice that the ventricle does not shrink to zero volume at the end of systole. In total, 120 − 50 = 70 mL of blood has left the ventricle during systole (i.e., between points D and F). Therefore, the stroke volume is substantially less than the maximum ventricular volume (i.e., EDV). The ejection fraction in this example is ~60%, which is in the normal range. Ejection occurs against aortic pressures ranging between 80 and 130 mm Hg. Therefore, ejection is not “isotonic” (see pp. 237–238 ).

Segment FA
Point F in Figure 22-9 represents the closing of the aortic valve. At this point, ejection has ended and isovolumetric relaxation is about to begin. The ventricular volume remains at 50 mL, while left ventricular pressure falls from ~100 mm Hg at point F to ~7 mm Hg at point A. At the end of isovolumetric relaxation, the mitral valve opens and the cardiac cycle starts all over again with ventricular filling.

The six segments of the pressure-volume loop in Figure 22-9 correspond to different phases of the cardiac cycle:

- Phase 1, the inflow phase, includes segments AB and BC.
• Phase 2, isovolumetric contraction, includes segment CD.
• Phase 3, the outflow phase, includes segments DE and EF.
• Phase 4, isovolumetric relaxation, includes segment FA.
Segments CDEF represent systole, whereas segments FABC represent diastole.
