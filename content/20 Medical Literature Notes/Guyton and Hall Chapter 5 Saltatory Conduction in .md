## Saltatory Conduction Occurs in Myelinated Fibers

Even though ions cannot flow significantly through the thick sheaths of myelinated neurons, they can flow with considerable ease through the nodes of Ranvier. Thus, the neuronal impulse jumps from node to node along the fiber, which is the origin of the term “saltatory.” Saltatory conduction is of value for two major reasons:

- *Increased velocity.*  By causing the depolarization process to jump long intervals (up to about 1.5 mm) along the axis of the nerve fiber, this mechanism increases the velocity of neuronal transmission in myelinated fibers as much as 5- to 50-fold.
- *Energy conservation.*  Saltatory conduction conserves energy for the axon because only the nodes depolarize, allowing perhaps a 100 times smaller movement of ions than would otherwise be necessary and therefore requiring little energy for reestablishing the sodium and potassium concentration differences across the membrane after a series of neuronal impulses.
