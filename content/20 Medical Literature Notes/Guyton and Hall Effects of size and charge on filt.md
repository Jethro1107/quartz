## Filterability of Solutes Inversely Related to Their Size

The glomerular capillary membrane is thicker than most other capillaries, but it is also much more porous and therefore filters fluid at a high rate. Despite the high filtration rate, the glomerular filtration barrier is selective in determining which molecules will be filtered, based on their size and electrical charge.

[Table 27-1](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/t0010) lists the effect of molecular size on filterability of different molecules. A filterability of 1.0 means that the substance is filtered as freely as water, whereas a filterability of 0.75 means that the substance is filtered only 75% as rapidly as water. Note that electrolytes such as sodium and small organic compounds such as glucose are freely filtered. As the molecular weight of the molecule approaches that of albumin, the filterability rapidly decreases, approaching zero.

Filterability of Substances by Glomerular Capillaries Based on Molecular Weight

| Substance | Molecular Weight | Filterability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Water | 18 | 1 |
| Sodium | 23 | 1 |
| Glucose | 180 | 1 |
| Inulin | 5500 | 1 |
| Myoglobin | 17,000 | 0.75 |
| Albumin | 69,000 | 0.005 |

## Negatively Charged Large Molecules Are Filtered Less Easily Than Positively Charged Molecules of Equal Molecular Size

The molecular diameter of the plasma protein albumin is only about 6 nanometers, whereas the pores of the glomerular membrane are thought to be about 8 nanometers (80 angstroms [Å]). Albumin is restricted from filtration, however, because of its negative charge and the electrostatic repulsion exerted by negative charges of the glomerular capillary wall proteoglycans.

[Figure 27-3](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0020) shows how electrical charge affects the filtration of different molecular weight dextrans by the glomerulus. Dextrans are polysaccharides that can be manufactured as neutral molecules or with negative or positive charges. Note that for any given molecular radius, positively charged molecules are filtered much more readily than negatively charged molecules. Neutral dextrans are also filtered more readily than negatively charged dextrans of equal molecular weight. The reason for these differences in filterability is that the negative charges of the basement membrane and podocytes provide an important means for restricting large negatively charged molecules, including the plasma proteins.

Figure 27-3 Effect of molecular radius and electrical charge of dextran on its filterability by the glomerular capillaries. A value of 1.0 indicates that the substance is filtered as freely as water, whereas a value of 0 indicates that it is not filtered. Dextrans are polysaccharides that can be manufactured as neutral molecules or with negative or positive charges and with varying molecular weights.
