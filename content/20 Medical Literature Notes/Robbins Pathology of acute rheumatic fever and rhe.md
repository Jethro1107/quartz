# Robbins: Pathology of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease

Created time: April 18, 2022 12:48 PM

Key pathologic features of acute RF and chronic RHD are shown in  [Fig. 12.22](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0115) . During acute RF, focal inflammatory lesions are found in various tissues. Distinctive lesions in the heart—called  **Aschoff bodies** —are composed of foci of T lymphocytes, occasional plasma cells, and plump activated macrophages called **Anitschkow cells.** These macrophages have abundant cytoplasm and central round-to-ovoid nuclei (occasionally binucleate) in which the chromatin condenses into a central, slender, wavy ribbon (hence the designation “caterpillar cells”).

During acute RF, diffuse inflammation and Aschoff bodies may be found in any of the three layers of the heart, resulting in pericarditis, myocarditis, or endocarditis **(pancarditis).**

Inflammation of the endocardium and the left-sided valves typically results in fibrinoid necrosis within the cusps or tendinous cords. Overlying these necrotic foci and along the lines of closure are small (1 to 2 mm) vegetations, called **verrucae.** Thus, RHD is one of the forms of vegetative valve disease, each of which exhibit their own characteristic morphologic features (  [Fig. 12.23](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0120) ). Subendocardial lesions, perhaps exacerbated by regurgitant jets, can induce irregular thickenings called  **MacCallum plaques,** usually in the left atrium.

The cardinal anatomic changes of the mitral valve in chronic RHD are  **leaflet thickening, commissural fusion and shortening, and thickening and fusion of the tendinous cords** (see  [Fig. 12.22D](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0115) ). The mitral valve is virtually always involved in chronic RHD; it is affected in isolation in roughly two-thirds of cases, and along with the aortic valve in another 25%. Tricuspid valve involvement is infrequent, and the pulmonary valve is only rarely affected.

In rheumatic mitral stenosis, calcification and fibrous bridging across the valvular commissures create “fish mouth” stenoses (see  [Fig. 12.22C](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0115) ). With tight mitral stenosis, the left atrium progressively dilates and may harbor mural thrombi that can embolize. Long-standing congestive changes in the lungs may induce pulmonary vascular and parenchymal changes; over time, these can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricle is largely unaffected by isolated pure mitral stenosis. Microscopically, valves show organization of the acute inflammation, with postinflammatory neovascularization and transmural fibrosis that obliterate the leaflet architecture. Aschoff bodies are rarely seen in surgical specimens or autopsy tissue from patients with chronic RHD, because of the long intervals between the initial insult and the development of the chronic deformity.

Figure 12.22

Acute and chronic rheumatic heart disease. (A) Acute rheumatic mitral valvulitis superimposed on chronic rheumatic heart disease. Small vegetations (verrucae) are visible along the line of closure of the mitral valve leaflet  *(arrows)*  . Previous episodes of rheumatic valvulitis have caused fibrous thickening and fusion of the chordae tendineae. (B) Microscopic appearance of an Aschoff body in a patient with acute rheumatic carditis. The myocardium exhibits a circumscribed nodule of mixed mononuclear inflammatory cells with associated necrosis; within the inflammation, large activated macrophages show prominent nucleoli, as well as chromatin condensed into long, wavy ribbons (caterpillar cells;  *arrows*  ). (C and D) Mitral stenosis with diffuse fibrous thickening and distortion of the valve leaflets and commissural fusion (  *arrows,*  C), and thickening of the chordae tendineae (D). Note the neovascularization of the anterior mitral leaflet (  *arrow,*  D). (E) Surgically resected specimen of rheumatic aortic stenosis, demonstrating thickening and distortion of the cusps with commissural fusion.
