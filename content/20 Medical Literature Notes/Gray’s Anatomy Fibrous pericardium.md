# Grayâ€™s Anatomy: Fibrous pericardium

Created time: March 29, 2022 2:20 PM

The fibrous pericardium is a cone-shaped bag with its base on the diaphragm and its apex continuous with the adventitia of the great vessels ( Fig. 3.59 ). The base is attached to the central tendon of the diaphragm and to a small muscular area of the diaphragm on the left side. Anteriorly, it is attached to the posterior surface of the sternum by sternopericardial ligaments . These attachments help to retain the heart in its position in the thoracic cavity. The sac also limits cardiac distention.
The phrenic nerves, which innervate the diaphragm and originate from spinal cord levels C3 to C5, pass through the fibrous pericardium and innervate the fibrous pericardium as they travel from their point of origin to their final destination ( Fig. 3.60 ). Their location, within the fibrous pericardium, is directly related to the embryological origin of the diaphragm and the changes that occur during the formation of the pericardial cavity. Similarly, the pericardiacophrenic vessels are also located within and supply the fibrous pericardium as they pass through the thoracic cavity.
