The story for *P*CO2 is analogous, again assuming that only one factor changes at a time. There is normally essentially no carbon dioxide in inspired air and so we can ignore that factor. A decreased alveolar ventilation will increase the alveolar *P*CO2 (see Figure 13–22) because there is less inspired fresh air to dilute the carbon dioxide entering the alveoli from the blood. Increased production of carbon dioxide will also increase the alveolar *P*CO2 because more carbon dioxide will be entering the alveoli from the blood per unit time. Recall that in the steady state, the volume of carbon dioxide entering the alveoli per unit time is always equal to the volume produced by the tissues.

2 factors affect alveolar PCO2, (1) the minute volume of CO2 produced and (2) alveolar ventilation

According to the equation, when the minute volume of CO2 produced increase, alveolar PCO2 increase

Qualitatively, this can be explained by the fact that more carbon dioxide will be entering the alveoli from the blood per unit time

When alveolar ventilation increase, alveolar PCO2 decrease because the minute volume of CO2 exhaled is reduced
