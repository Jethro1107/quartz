**Glomerular filtration barrier.**

The glomerular filtration barrier consists of three layered components: the fenestrated capillary endothelium, the glomerular basement membrane, and filtration slits between podocyte processes. The major component of the filter is formed by fusion of the basal laminae of a podocyte and a capillary endothelial cell. **(a):** TEM showing cell bodies of two podocytes (PC) and the series of pedicels on the glomerular basement membrane separated by the filtration slits (arrows). On the other side of the membrane is the thin lining of a capillary (C) endothelial cell, with fenestrations. Together these openings allow filtration of liquid from plasma into the urinary space (US) of Bowman's capsule.

The endothelial fenestrations in glomeruli lack diaphragms, but very thin slit diaphragms cross the space between pedicels and play an important role in filtration. X45,750.

The pedicels interdigitate, defining elongated spaces 30–40 nm wide—the **filtration slits** (Figure 19–6). Spanning adjacent processes (and thus bridging the filtration slits) is a thin semipermeable diaphragm of uniform thickness (Figure 19–6). These **slit diaphragms** are a highly specialized type of intercellular junction in which the large transmembrane protein **nephrin** is important both structurally and functionally. Projecting from the cell membrane on each side of the slit, nephrin molecules interact to form a porous structure within the diaphragm.

Between the highly fenestrated endothelial cells of the capillaries and the covering podocytes is the thick (~0.1 m) glomerular basement membrane (Figure 19–6). This membrane is the most substantial part of the filtration barrier separating the blood in the capillaries from the capsular space. It is formed by the fusion of capillary- and podocyte-produced basal laminae and is maintained by the podocytes. Laminin and fibronectin in this fused basement membrane bind integrins of both the podocyte and endothelial cell membranes. The meshwork of type IV collagen cross-linked in a matrix of negatively charged proteoglycans may help restrict the passage of cationic molecules. Thus, the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is a selective macromolecular barrier which acts as a physical filter and as a barrier against negatively charged molecules.

The initial glomerular filtrate has a chemical composition similar to that of the blood plasma except that it contains very little protein because macromolecules do not readily cross the glomerular filter. Proteins and other particles greater than 10 nm in diameter or exceeding 70 kDa, the approximate molecular mass of albumin, do not readily cross the glomerular barrier.
