## Mechanisms of Apoptosis

**Apoptosis is regulated by biochemical pathways that control the balance of death- and survival-inducing signals and ultimately the activation of enzymes called *caspases* .** Caspases were so named because they are cysteine proteases that cleave proteins after aspartic acid residues. Two distinct pathways converge on caspase activation: the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor pathway ( [Fig. 2.12](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0065) ). Although these pathways can intersect, they are generally induced under different conditions, involve different molecules, and serve distinct roles in physiology and disease. The end result of apoptotic cell death is the clearance of apoptotic bodies by phagocytes.

- **The mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway seems to be responsible for apoptosis in most physiologic and pathologic situations.** Mitochondria contain several proteins that are capable of inducing apoptosis, including cytochrome c. When mitochondrial membranes become permeable, cytochrome c leaks out into the cytoplasm, triggering caspase activation and apoptotic death. A family of more than 20 proteins, the prototype of which is Bcl-2, controls the permeability of mitochondria. In healthy cells, Bcl-2 and the related protein Bcl-xL, which are produced in response to growth factors and other stimuli, maintain the integrity of mitochondrial membranes, in large part by holding two proapoptotic members of the family, Bax and Bak, in check. When cells are deprived of growth factors and survival signals, or are exposed to agents that damage DNA, or accumulate unacceptable amounts of misfolded proteins, a number of sensors are activated. These sensors are called BH3 proteins because they contain the third domain seen in Bcl-family proteins. They in turn shift this delicate, life-sustaining balance in favor of pro-apoptotic Bak and Bax. As a result, Bak and Bax dimerize, insert into the mitochondrial membrane, and form channels through which cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins escape into the cytosol. After cytochrome c enters the cytosol, it, together with certain cofactors, activates caspase-9. The net result is the activation of a caspase cascade, ultimately leading to nuclear fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies.
- **The death receptor (extrinsic) pathway of apoptosis.** Many cells express surface molecules, called death receptors, that trigger apoptosis. Most of these are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, which contain in their cytoplasmic regions a conserved “death domain,” so named because it mediates interaction with other proteins involved in cell death. The prototypic death receptors are the type I TNF receptor and Fas (CD95). Fas ligand (FasL) is a membrane protein expressed mainly on activated T lymphocytes. When these T cells recognize Fas-expressing targets, Fas molecules are crosslinked by FasL and bind adaptor proteins via the death domain. These then recruit and activate caspase-8, which, in turn, activates downstream caspases. The death receptor pathway is involved in the elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes and in the killing of target cells by some cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that express FasL.
    
    In either pathway, after caspase-9 or caspase-8 is activated, it cleaves and thereby activates additional caspases that cleave numerous targets and ultimately activate enzymes that degrade the cells' proteins and nucleus. The end result is the characteristic cellular fragmentation of apoptosis.
    
- **Clearance of apoptotic cells.** Apoptotic cells and their fragments entice phagocytes by producing a number of “eat-me” signals. For instance, in normal cells, phosphatidylserine is present on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, but in apoptotic cells this phospholipid “flips” to the outer leaflet, where it is recognized by tissue macrophages, leading to phagocytosis of the apoptotic cells. Cells that are dying by apoptosis also secrete soluble factors that recruit phagocytes. The plasma membrane alterations and secreted proteins facilitate prompt clearance of the dead cells before the cells undergo membrane damage and release their contents (which can induce inflammation). Numerous macrophage receptors have been shown to be involved in the binding and engulfment of apoptotic cells. The phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is so efficient that dead cells disappear without leaving a trace, and inflammation is virtually absent.

Mechanisms of apoptosis. The two pathways of apoptosis differ in their induction and regulation, and both culminate in the activation of caspases. In the mitochondrial pathway, BH3-only proteins, which are related to members of the Bcl-2 family, sense a lack of survival signals or DNA or protein damage. These BH3-only proteins activate effector molecules that increase mitochondrial permeability. In concert with a deficiency of Bcl-2 and other proteins that maintain mitochondrial permeability, the mitochondria become leaky and various substances, such as cytochrome c, enter the cytosol and activate caspases. Activated caspases induce the changes that culminate in cell death and fragmentation. In the death receptor pathway, signals from plasma membrane receptors lead to the assembly of adaptor proteins into a “death-inducing signaling complex,” which activates caspases, and the end result is the same.
