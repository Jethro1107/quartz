# Junqueira’s Histology: Uroepithelium

Created time: March 10, 2022 10:09 AM

The urothelium is composed of the following three layers:

a single layer of small basal cells resting on a very thin basement membrane,

an intermediate region containing from one to several layers of more columnar cells,

a superficial layer of very large, polyhedral or bulbous cells called **umbrella cells** which are occasionally bi- or multinucleated and are highly differentiated to protect underlying cells against the cytotoxic effects of hypertonic urine.

Umbrella cells are especially well developed in the bladder (Figures19–16and19–17) where contact with urine is the greatest.These cells, up to 100 micrometers in diameter, have extensive intercellular junctional complexes surrounding unique apical membranes. Most of the apical surface consists of **asymmetric unit membranes**, in which regions of the outer lipid layer appear twice as thick as the inner leaflet. These regions are lipid rafts containing mostly integral membrane proteins called **uroplakins** which assemble into paracrystalline arrays of stiffened plaques 16 nm in diameter. Urine contacts primarily these membranous plaques, which are impermeable and protect cytoplasm and underlying cells from its hyperosmotic effects. Plaques are hinged together by more narrow regions of typical membrane. When the bladder is emptied, not only does the mucosa fold extensively, but individual umbrella cells decrease their apical surface area by folding the membrane at its hinge domains and internalizing the folded plaques in discoidal vesicles. As the bladder fills again the discoidal vesicles rejoin the apical membrane, increasing its surface area as the cell shape changes from round to flat. The urothelium becomes thinner, apparently the result of the intermediate cells being pushed and pulled laterally to accommodate the increased volume of urine.
