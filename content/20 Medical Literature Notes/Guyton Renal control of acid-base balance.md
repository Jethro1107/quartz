# Summary

- Three basic mechanisms of renal control of acid-base homeostasis: 1) Secretion of H+, 2) Reabsorption of HCO3- and 3) De nevo synthesis of HCO3-
- Secretion of H+ and reabsorption of HCO3- by renal tubules (1 and 2)
    
    General rule of thumb, no matter the segment of kidney tubules, for each HCO3- reabsorbed, an H+ must be secreted
    
    In the early segments. i.e. PCT, H+ is secreted by secondary active transport. Filtered HCO3- is reabsorbed by interactions with the secreted H+

    In the late segments, i.e. collecting duct, H+ is secreted by only primary active transport in IC-A cells, and HCO3- is also reabsorbed by similar mechanisms
    
- Combination of excess H+ with phosphate and ammonium buffer systems generates new HCO3- (1 and 3)
    
    Phosphate buffer - Excess H+ is buffered by phosphate, note that since all HCO3- is reabsorbed, the HCO3- taken into blood is an addition of a new HCO3-, rather than the reabsorption of filtered HCO3-
    
    Ammonium buffer system
    
    In PCT, glutamine metabolism is involved in synthesis of new HCO3-
    
    In collecting ducts, it involves secretion of NH3, which titrates excess H+ in urine
    
    H+ secreted is accompanied by a new HCO3- added to blood
