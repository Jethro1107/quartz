## Pathogenesis

Clinically significant emphysema is largely confined to smokers and to patients with α 1 -antitrypsin deficiency, highlighting the importance of these two etiologic factors. Mechanisms relating to these factors that contribute to the development of emphysema include the following ( [Fig. 15.8](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0045) ):

- *Toxic injury and inflammation.* Inhaled cigarette smoke and other noxious particles damage respiratory epithelium and cause inflammation, which results in variable degrees of parenchymal destruction. A wide variety of inflammatory mediators (including leukotriene B 4 , interleukin [IL]-8, TNF, and others) are increased in the affected parts of the lung. These mediators are released by resident epithelial cells and macrophages and variously attract inflammatory cells from the circulation (chemotactic factors), amplify the inflammatory process (proinflammatory cytokines), and induce structural changes (growth factors). Chronic inflammation also leads to the accumulation of T and B cells in affected parts of the lung, but the role of adaptive immunity in emphysema is currently uncertain.
- *Protease-antiprotease imbalance.* Several proteases are released from the inflammatory cells and epithelial cells that break down connective tissue components. In patients who develop emphysema, there is a relative deficiency of protective antiproteases, which in some instances has a genetic basis (discussed later).
- *Oxidative stress.* Substances in tobacco smoke, alveolar damage, and inflammatory cells all produce oxidants, which may beget tissue damage, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation. The role of oxidants is supported by studies of mice in which the *NRF2* gene is inactivated. NRF2 is a transcription factor that serves as a sensor for oxidants in many cell types including alveolar epithelial cells. Intracellular oxidants activate *NRF2,* which upregulates the expression of genes that protect cells from oxidant damage. Mice without *NRF2* are significantly more sensitive to tobacco smoke than normal mice, and genetic variants in *NRF2, NRF2* regulators, and *NRF2* target genes are all associated with smoking-related lung disease in humans.
- *Infection.* Although infection is not thought to play an initiating role in the tissue destruction, bacterial and/or viral infections may acutely exacerbate existing disease.

**The idea that proteases are important is based in part on the observation that patients with a genetic deficiency of the antiprotease α 1 -antitrypsin have a markedly enhanced tendency to develop emphysema that is compounded by smoking.** About 1% of all patients with emphysema have this defect. α 1 -Antitrypsin, normally present in serum, tissue fluids, and macrophages, is a major inhibitor of proteases (particularly elastase) secreted by neutrophils during inflammation. It is encoded by the proteinase inhibitor *(Pi)* locus on chromosome 14. The *Pi* locus is polymorphic, and approximately 0.012% of the U.S. population is homozygous for the *Z* allele, a genotype associated with very low serum levels of α 1 -antitrypsin. More than 80% of *ZZ* individuals develop symptomatic panacinar emphysema, which occurs at an earlier age and is of greater severity if the individual smokes. It is postulated that any injury (e.g., that induced by smoking) that increases the activation and influx of neutrophils into the lung leads to local release of proteases, which in the absence of α 1 -antitrypsin activity result in excessive digestion of elastic tissue and, with time, emphysema.

Several other genetic variants have also been linked to risk of emphysema. Among these are variants of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that are hypothesized to influence the addictiveness of tobacco smoke and thus the behavior of smokers. Not surprisingly, the same variants are also linked to lung cancer risk, emphasizing the importance of smoking in both of these diseases.

A number of factors contribute to airway obstruction in emphysema. Small airways are normally held open by the elastic recoil of the lung parenchyma. The loss of elastic tissue in the walls of alveoli that surround respiratory bronchioles reduces radial traction, leading to collapse of respiratory bronchioles during expiration and functional airflow obstruction in the absence of mechanical obstruction. In addition, even young smokers often have changes related to small airway inflammation that also contribute to airway narrowing and obstruction (described later).
