## Pathogenesis

The primary or initiating factor in the genesis of chronic bronchitis is exposure to noxious or irritating inhaled substances such as tobacco smoke (90% of those affected are smokers) and dust from grain, cotton, and silica. Several factors contribute to its pathogenesis.

- *Mucus hypersecretion.* The earliest feature of chronic bronchitis is hypersecretion of mucus in the large airways, associated with enlargement of the submucosal glands in the trachea and bronchi. The basis for mucus hypersecretion is incompletely understood, but it appears to involve inflammatory mediators such as histamine and IL-13. With time, there is also a marked increase in goblet cells in small airways—small bronchi and bronchioles—leading to excessive mucus production that contributes to airway obstruction. It is thought that both the enlargement of submucosal glands and the increase in numbers of goblet cells are protective reactions against tobacco smoke or other pollutants (e.g., sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide).
- *Acquired cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction.* There is substantial evidence that smoking leads to acquired CFTR dysfunction, which in turn causes the secretion of abnormal, dehydrated mucus that exacerbates the severity of chronic bronchitis.
- *Inflammation.* Inhalants that induce chronic bronchitis cause cellular damage, eliciting both acute and chronic inflammatory responses involving neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Long-standing inflammation and accompanying fibrosis involving small airways (small bronchi and bronchioles, less than 2 to 3 mm in diameter) can also lead to chronic airway obstruction.
- *Infection.* Infection does not initiate chronic bronchitis, but is probably significant in maintaining it and may be critical in producing acute exacerbations.

Cigarette smoke predisposes to chronic bronchitis in several ways. Not only does it damage airway-lining cells, leading to chronic inflammation, but it also interferes with the ciliary action of the respiratory epithelium, preventing the clearance of mucus and increasing the risk of infection.
