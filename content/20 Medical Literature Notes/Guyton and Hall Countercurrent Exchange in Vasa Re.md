## Countercurrent Exchange in Vasa Recta Preserves Hyperosmolarity of Renal Medulla

Blood flow must be provided to the renal medulla to supply the metabolic needs of the cells in this part of the kidney. Without a special medullary blood flow system, the solutes pumped into the renal medulla by the countercurrent multiplier system would be rapidly dissipated.

Two special features of the renal medullary blood flow contribute to the preservation of the high solute concentrations:

1. The medullary blood flow is low, accounting for less than 5% of the total renal blood flow. This sluggish blood flow is sufficient to supply the metabolic needs of the tissues but helps minimize solute loss from the medullary interstitium.
2. The vasa recta serve as *countercurrent exchangers* , minimizing the washout of solutes from the medullary interstitium.

The countercurrent exchange mechanism operates as follows ( [Figure 29-7](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0040) ). Blood enters and leaves the medulla via the vasa recta at the boundary of the cortex and renal medulla. The vasa recta, like other capillaries, are highly permeable to solutes in the blood, except for the plasma proteins. As blood descends into the medulla toward the papillae, it becomes progressively more concentrated, partly by solute entry from the interstitium and partly by loss of water into the interstitium. By the time the blood reaches the tips of the vasa recta, it has a concentration of about 1200 mOsm/L, the same as that of the medullary interstitium. As blood ascends back toward the cortex, it becomes progressively less concentrated as solutes diffuse back out into the medullary interstitium and as water moves into the vasa recta.

Figure 29-7Countercurrent exchange in the vasa recta. Plasma flowing down the descending limb of the vasa recta becomes more hyperosmotic because of diffusion of water out of the blood and diffusion of solutes from the renal interstitial fluid into the blood. In the ascending limb of the vasa recta, solutes diffuse back into the interstitial fluid, and water diffuses back into the vasa recta. Large amounts of solutes would be lost from the renal medulla without the U shape of the vasa recta capillaries.Numerical values are in milliosmoles per liter.

Although large amounts of fluid and solute are exchanged across the vasa recta, there is little net dilution of the concentration of the interstitial fluid at each level of the renal medulla because of the U shape of the vasa recta capillaries, which act as countercurrent exchangers. *Thus* , *the vasa recta do not create the medullary hyperosmolarity* , *but they do prevent it from being dissipated.*

The U-shaped structure of the vessels minimizes loss of solute from the interstitium but does not prevent bulk flow of fluid and solutes into the blood through the usual colloid osmotic and hydrostatic pressures that favor reabsorption in these capillaries. Under steady-state conditions, the vasa recta carry away only as much solute and water as is absorbed from the medullary tubules, and the high concentration of solutes established by the countercurrent mechanism is preserved.
