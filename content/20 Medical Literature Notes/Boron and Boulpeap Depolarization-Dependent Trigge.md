# Boron and Boulpeap: Depolarization-Dependent Triggered Activity

Created time: March 17, 2022 4:44 PM

- A positive shift in the maximum diastolic potential brings V m closer to the threshold for an action potential and can induce automaticity in cardiac tissue that otherwise has no pacemaker activity. The development of depolarization-induced triggered activity depends on the interaction of the Ca 2+ current ( I Ca ) and the repolarizing K + current ( I K ). This mechanism can produce a more rapid pacemaker depolarization in the SA or AV nodal cells, causing them to accelerate their pacemakers. It can also increase the intrinsic pacemaker rate in Purkinje fiber cells, which normally have a very slow pacemaker. Depolarization-induced triggered activity is particularly dramatic in nonpacemaker tissues (e.g., ventricular muscle), which normally exhibit no diastolic depolarization. Factors that significantly prolong action potential duration can cause depolarization-dependent triggered activity. During the repolarization phase, I Na remains inactivated because the cell is so depolarized ( Fig. 21-16 A ). On the other hand, I Ca has had enough time to recover from inactivation and—because the cell is still depolarized—triggers a slow, positive deflection in V m known as an early afterdepolarization (EAD). N21-16 Eventually, I K increases and returns V m toward the resting potential. Such EADs, if they are larger than the one shown in Figure 21-16 A , may trigger an extrasystole. Isolated ventricular extrasystoles (known by many names, including premature ventricular contractions, or PVCs) may occur in normal individuals. Alterations in cellular Ca 2+ metabolism (discussed in the next section) may increase the tendency of a prolonged action potential to produce an extrasystole. Ironically, a class of drugs used to treat arrhythmias can become arrhythmogenic by producing EADs. For example, quinidine can produce this dangerous adverse effect, presumably by inhibiting Na + channels and some K + channels and thus prolonging the ventricular muscle action potential. Figure 21-16  Abnormal automaticity in ventricular muscle. The records in this figure are idealized. A, The prolonged action potential keeps I Na inactivated but permits I Ca and I K to interact and thereby produce a spontaneous depolarization—the early afterdepolarization. B, The afterdepolarization reaches threshold, triggering a sequence of several slow pacemaker-like action potentials that generate extrasystoles.
