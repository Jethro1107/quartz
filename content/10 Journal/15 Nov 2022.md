        - [[Interferon]]
            - MOA of interferons and pegylated interferons
                - Essentially functions like INF produced by our body: Inducing anti-viral state in cells
                - Antiviral proteins that alert cells that there is a virus around, and direct our immune system to produce various types of antiviral protein that can block viral reproduction in many ways
            - Pegylation: Conjugation with polyethylene glycol (*************************************************hence PEGloticase, a recombinant urate oxidase that is conjugated with methoxyPOLYETHYLENE GLYCOL, to increase duration of action*************************************************
            - Interferon: IM or SC injection 2-3 times a week for 6 months to a year
                - Pegylated interferon have a longer duration of action, hence injection once a week for 6 months to a year is sufficient
            - Pegylated interfero alpha-2a vs pegylated interferon-alpha-2b
                - 2a:
                    - Fixed weekly dose
                    - Relatively constant absorption after injection
                    - Distributed mostly in blood and organs, such that the same concentration in liver is achieved, no need dose adjustment
                - 2b:
                    - Weekly dose adjusted by bodyweight
                    - Rapid absorption
                    - Wider distribution in the body
                    - Increase in weight will result in lower concentration in liver, hence requires dose adjustment by weight
            - Adverse effect of pegylated interferons
                - Flu-like illness - Headache, fever, chill muscle ache
                - Insomnia
                - Depression
                - Skin rash
                - GI
            - Precautions:
                - Cannot be used in decompensated cirrhosis
                - Expensive
                - Serious side effects in some
            - Pros:
                - Shorter duration of treatment
[[Nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)]]
            - Examples of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
                - Entecavir
                - Tenofovir
                - Adefovir
                - Lamivudine
                - Telbivudine
            - MOA of NRTI
                - Nucleoside analogue, Competitive inhibitor for HBV reverse transcriptase
                - Binds to DNA, acts as a chain terminator, preventing DNA elongation
                - The NRTIs act by competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase; incorporation into the growing viral DNA chain causes premature chain termination due to inhibition of binding with the incoming nucleotide ([Figure 49–3](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?bookid=2988&sectionid=250602382#katz15_ch49fg3)

            - NS3/4A inhibitors have high potency, limited genotypical coverage, and low barrier to resistance
- 2:49pm - When reviewing biochemistry bone, I realise that the note titled ‘cartilage matrix’ states that the function of type II collagen is the mere provision of tensile strength, but then in notes about pathogenesis of OA, it talks about how the collagen forms a network of opposing water entry, hence in degradation of articular cartilage in OA, the 1st stage is the swelling and soft articular cartilage on arthroscopy
    - How do I refine this? [[EditLater]]
        - Read junquiera
        - Read notes on pathology of OA
        - MSS03 Lecture slides
- [[Biochemistry of bone and cartilage]]  - Review 1
    - Forgot the names of GAG and proteoglycans in bones
    - Subunits of GAG
    - Started notes on an important adhesive glycoprotein - [[Fibronectin]]
        
        
        - Adhesive glycoprotein in cartilage matrix
            - An important adhesive glycoprotein in cartilage matrix is fibronectin
            - Its functional form is a disulhide bonded dimer, which forms a fibrillar matrix that is further stabilised by extensive disulphide bonding
            - It binds to collagen, heparin sulphate proteoglycans, fibrin, at different domains.
            - Particularly binds to cell surfaces via integrin receptors at the RGD (Arginine-Glycine, Aspartate) motif.
        - Fibronectin
            - Fibronectin is a multiadhesive glycoprotein that holds ECM together
            - The dimer binds to collagen, heparin sulphate proteoglycans, fibrin, and integrin
            - Integrin mediates weak cell-matrix and cell-cell interaction [[Integrins interact with the extracellular matrix via RGD motif]]
                - A large family of transmembrane proteins, heterodimer, 17 alpha subunits, 8 beta subunits
                - the matrix binding domain binds to ECM in a sequence specific manner, particular to RGD motifs (Arginine, Glycine-Aspartate)
                - The intracellular domain interacts with cytoskeleton to transduce a cellular signal
                - May cooperate with other receptors such as DDR receptors to enhance specificity
    - Proteglycans vs glycoprotein
        - Proteoglycans - the GAG moiety dominates, both structurally and functionally
        - Glycoprotein - the protein moiety dominates
- [[Compression disorders]]
    - Terminologies
        - Spinal cord - CNS tissue with cell bodies and ascending and descending tract
        - Nerve roots - Consist of mainly lower motor neurons
            - Cauda equina are nerve roots in lumbosacral spine
                - Claudication
                    - Symptoms of cauda eqquina lesions - Burning sensation or numbness when walking
                - Sciatica
                    - Associated with sciatic nerve (L4 to S3 nerve roots)
        - Radiculopathy
            - Nerve root lesion, i.e. lower motor neuron lesions
        - Myelopathy
            - Spinal cord lesion, i.e. upper motor neuron lesion.
    - History taking when suspecting nerve compression disorders
        - Pain - location, character, severity, aggravating and relieving factors
        - Numbness - any compression of sensory fibres in nerve roots (something to consider, glove and stocking distribution)
        - Weakness - Compression on motor fibres in nerve root or spinal cord
        - Balance - proprioception, or due to severe weakness
        - Sphincter control - Bowel and bladder control, this is related to very severe myelopathy AS I RECALL FROM PBL
    - Just a review of anatomy of the spine
        - Intervertebral foramina - bordered by the superior and inferior vertebral arch, intervertebral disc
        - Vertebral foramen - Between vertebral body and vertebral arch, where successions of vertebral foramen forms the vertebral arch
    - [[Lumbar spinal stenosis]] can be separated into foraminal area, lateral recess and central area
        - Compression at central area results in compression of the nerve roots innervating beyond the vertebral/spinal level
        - Lateral recess, results in compression of nerve roots through the spinal level below
            - Does this mean, if IV disc between L4/5 herniate into lateral recess of spinal canal, it will result in compression of nerve root at L4 spinal level
            - Because nerve root traverse the intervertebral foramina below the corresponding vertebrae
    - Lumbar Spinal stenosis causes
        - Intervertebral disc herniation
        - Osteophytes
        - Facet joint hypertrophy can cause lateral or central compression, consider the orientation of lumbar spinal facets, treat by medial facetomy
        - Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy - Between pedicles, treat by ligamentum flavum removal
    - Cervical spine anatomy
        - 5 articulations, rather than 3
            - Intervertebral disc
            - 2 facet joints
            - 2 uncovertebral joints
        - Borders of intervertebral foramina
            - Superior: pedicle of vertebra above
            - Inferior: Pedicle of vertebra below
            - Posterolaterally: facet joint
            - Anteromedially, uncovertebral joint and intervertebral disc
        - 8 cervical nerve roots, for 7 cervical vertebrae
            - C1 leaves above C1
            - C8 leaves below C7
    - [[Cervical radiculopathy]]
        - Cervical radiculopathy is a pathological process involving nerve root irritation (commonly in the intervertebral foramina?), that manifests as neck, arm, shoulder pain, muscle weakness (motor symptoms), and sensory symptoms.
        - Causes
            - IV disc herniation into the intervertebral foramina (foraminal, or lateral) is more likely to manifest as cervical radiculopathy
            - Osteophyte spurs - cervical spondylosis (degenerative changes in cervical vertebrae that results in osteophyte formation posteriorly, at the facet joints), and at the uncovertebral process
        - Clinical features
            - Compatible spinal level
            - Dermatomal
            - Sharp pain, and tingling or burning sensation
            - Neck pain - As dorsal root also innervate the facet joints.
            - Neck, and upper limb pain, motor and sensory symptoms
            - Hyporeflexia (deminished tendon reflex)
    
    - Cervical myelopathy
        - Causes
            - IV disc herniation into spinal canal, centrally
            - Osteophytes
            - Ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), also a common cause
            - Deformed uncovertebral process
            - Apophyseal, Zygapophyseal facet joint hypertrophy (Same thing)
            - Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy
        - Clinical features (may need to read pbl notes or robbins or kumar and clarke)
            - Weakness in both upper and lower limb
            - Neck pain
            - Non dermatomal
            - Non compatable spinal level
- **Uncovertebral “joints”**
 or **clefts - Moores anatomy [[EditLater]]**
    - (of Luschka) commonly develop between the unci of the bodies of C3 or C4–C6 or C7 vertebrae and the beveled inferolateral surfaces of the vertebral bodies superior to them after 10 years of age (Fig. 2.16
    ). The joints are at the lateral and posterolateral margins of the IV discs. The articulating surfaces of these joint-like structures are covered with cartilage moistened by fluid contained within an interposed potential space, or “capsule.” They are considered synovial joints by some; others consider them to be degenerative spaces (clefts) in the discs occupied by extracellular fluid. The uncovertebral “joints” are frequent sites of bone spur formation in later years, which may cause neck pain.
