- [[Reflex]]
    - Definition
        - A rapid, automatic and predictable response to specific stimulus, mediated by a typical reflex arc
            - Fast and sterotypical
        - A reflex arc is a neural pathway that coordinates a response to the instruction of motor neuron
    - Classification
        - Number of synapse: Monosynaptic, Polysnaptic
        - Innate or acquired (Physiological or psychological)
        - Spinal reflex vs cranial reflex
            - Spinal reflexes usually involve the spinal cord, and is involved in reflex in the limbs and trunk
            - Cranial reflex involves cranial nerves and the brain, and usually for stimuli received in head and neck
        - Somatic reflex or autoomic reflex
            - Depends on effector
                - Skeletal muscles, vs smooth/cardiac muscles and glands
    - Examples of somatic reflex
        - Proprioception - the perception of the relative position in our body
        - Stretch reflex and golgi tendon reflex
            - Physiological anatomy of the a muscle
                - Consist of extrafusal muscle fibres - which are contracted, and are innervated by alpha motor neurons (efferent)
                - Intrafusal muscle fibres - non-contractile, innervated by 1a and II sensory nerve fibres and gamma motor neurons (efferent)
                - Change in length in the intrafusal muscle fibres sends action potential via sensory nerve fibres to the spinal cord
            - [[Stretch reflex]]
                - Increase stretch of the muscle fibre, results in activation of intrafusal muscle fibres, and increases ap firing in 1a sensory nerve fibres
                - This activates alpha motor neuron within the same muscle fibre, and excites inhibitory motor neuron, thus results in reciprocal inhibition of  alpha motor neuron for the antagonist muscle
                - Also alpha-gamma co-activation
                    - Also gamma muscle fibres activated, shortening of intrafusal muscle fibres, enabling proprioceptors to maintain activity

                    Muscle tone is regulated by primary motor cortex via the alpha-gamma loop
                    
                - Examples:
                    - Knee jerk reflex
                    - Achilles reflex
                    - Biceps reflex,
                    - brachioradialis reflex
                    - Triceps reflex
            - [[Golgi tendon reflex]]
                - Protective reflex
                - Contracting muscles increase tension on tendon, activates golgi tendon organ, increasing rate of action potential in 1b sensory fibres
                    - Via a polysynaptic reflex in the spinal cord, via inhibitory interneurons inhibits alpha motor neuron to the agonist (same muscle)
                    - and via excitatory interneuron, stimulates alpha motor neuron to antagonist,
    - [[Upper motor neuron lesion and Lower motor neuron lesion]]
        - Both characterised with motor deficits that is muscle weakness

- Reflex
    - [[Stretch reflex]]
        - [[Physiological anatomy of a skeletal muscle]]
            - Consist of extrafusal muscle fibres, surrounding intrafusal muscle fibres
            - The extrafusal muscle fibres are contractile, and are innervated by alpha motor neurons
            - The intrafusal muscle fibres are much thinner muscle fibres
                - At the centre of the muscle fibres, it lacks sarcomeres, which makes them non-contractile. They serve as the receptor that detect the stretch of the muscle and participates in the stretch reflex, and are innervated by Ia and II sensory nerve fibres
                    - Stretching of the whole muscle will cause stretching of the central portion, therefore excites the receptor
                    - Even if the length of the entire muscle does not change, contraction of the end portion of the intrafusal muscle fibre (by gamma motor neuron stimulation), will stretch the central portion, therefore, exciting the receptor
                - The two ends of the intrafusal muscle fibres are contractile, and are innervated by gamma motor neurons.
    - [[Golgi tendon reflex]]
        - Golgi tension reflex is a somatic reflex that responds to tension created by muscle, applied to the tendon, and results in reflex relaxation of the muscle
        - Reflex arc in the golgi tendon reflex
            - Golgi tendon organ (a receptor in the tendon), is stimulated by excessive tension.
            - This increases the rate of action potential in Ib fibres, which enter the spinal cord via the dorsal rot.
            - It stimulates an inhibitory interneuron, which inhibits the alpha motor neuron
        - Role of golgi tendon reflex
            - A protective reflex that prevents extreme tension on the muscle, prevent tearing of muscle or avusion of the tendon from its attachment
    - Superficial cord reflexes are pathological in adults, normal manifestation, i.e. no reflex, requires (inhibitory?) descending activity from supraspinal levels
    - [[Pupillary light reflex]]
        - Pupilary light reflex is an autonomic reflex that responds to light, by constriction of both pupils
        - Reflex arc
            - When retinal ganglion cells detect light, it sends a nerve impulse via the optic nerve to the pretectal nucleus unilaterally, which stimulates the accessory oculomotor nucleus bilaterally. This stimulates parasympathetic efferent pathway, via the oculomotor nerve that results in constriction in both pupils
        - Sensory deficit of one eye results in impaired pupil constriction of both eyes when the eye is stimulated
        - Motor deficit of one eye results in impaired pupil constriction of eye when either eye is stimulated

- [[Chronic illness]]
    - Umbrella term that describes a condition that requires ongoing, long term care
        - Caused by an irreversible pathological change
    - Increasing prevalance of chronic illness due to:
        - Population aging - predominant in old individuals
        - Better medical care - Better emergency treatments increase survival from acute illness or trauma. Also availability of health screening
        - Change in lifestyle - increase sedentary time, unhealthy diet
        - Change in environment, e.g. pollution
    - Chronic illness is associated with some degree of [[Impairment and disability]]
        - Disability definition
            - Defined as any condition of the body or mind (impairment) that makes it more difficult for the person with the condition to do certain activities (activity limitation), and interact with the world around them (participation restriction)
            - Disability requires an impairment, that results in activity limitation and participation restriction
            - But impairment need not to result in activity limitation, or participation restriction. Social and politcal factors determine the built environment that determines whether an impairment becomes a disability
    - From the patients perspective, what does it mean to be chronically ill?
        - Managing medical regimens
            - In outpatient setting, requires them to learn how to manage symptoms and manifestations
            - Learn new skills and gain useful information in managing their chronic illness.
            - Challenge is compliance:
                - Overwhelmed by the life-long commitment
                - Interferes with job
        - Biographical disruption
        - Disruption of family and social life
            - Change in family roles and relationships
            - Strains on family member due to provision of high level of care and support
            - Withdrawal from key social roles
            - Social isolation
        - Uncertainty
            - Pre-dx, trajectory, symptomatic
        - Cost of being chronically ill
