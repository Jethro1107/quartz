    - [ ]  Skin and soft tissue infections and bone infections
- [[Skin and soft tissue infections]]
    - Pathogenesis of SSTI
        - The skin acts as a physical barrier, hence, often requiring a breach in normal integrity of the skin
        - Alteration of normal skin flora
        - Change in local environment of tissues, presence of devitalized tissues, hematoma, foreign bodies
        - Introduction to virulent exogenous or endogenous microbial flora
    - Classification of SSTI
        - Dermatophytosis/ringworms (most superficial infection) - Infection of keratinized tissue by keratinolytic dermatophytes
            - Group of fungal (moulds to be exact) species - Trichophyton rubrum, Microsporum, Epidermophyton floccosum
            - Sample: scaling skin sample or nail clippings
            - Diagnosis: KOH (dissolves keratin) wet mount and fungal culture for etiological dx
        - Paronychia - Superficial infection of the nail fold
            - Acute paronychia is caused by StaphA
            - Chronic paronychia is caused by Candida
        - Consider pyoderma, cellulitis and erysipelas as a group
            - Pyoderma (pyo - abcess, derma - skin, literally meaning pus in skin, or pyogenic abcess of the skin) - impetigo, folliculitis
                - Impetigo - a superficial intra-epidermal unilocular vesicopustule
                    - Clinical picture - golden yellow crust
                    - Textbook description - highly communicable in children due to frequent body contact… (but also in sports players)
                    - Caused by GAS, StaphA, or mixed
                - Folliculitis - abscess formation around hair follicle, most causes are caused by staphylococcus aureus
                - Skin abscess - furuncle (subcutaneous abscess), carbuncle (multiple coalescing furuncles), carbuncles usually in back region of elderly, diabetic or immunocomprimised patients
            - Erysipelas
                - A form of cellulitis (acute spreading infection of the skin), characterised with well-demarcated lesions and spreads rapidly
                - Classically affects face, but now mostly affect lower limb
                - Caused by gAS mainly
            - Cellulitis
                - Acute spreading infection of the skin extending to involve the subcutaneous tissue
                - Caused by beta-haemolytic streptococci (especially GAS), sometimes staphylococcus aureus or other bacteria
                - Note the clinical features:
                    - Local signs of inflammation, ill-defined margin of inflammation (erythema not well demarcated as it involves deeper layers), with or without local abscess,
                    - fever, chills and bacteraemia
        - [[Necrotising soft tissue infections]]
            - Necrotizing fasciitis is a necrotizing infection of the deep structures of the skin including the underlying fascia. In myonecrosis, the underlying muscle becomes necrotic.
            - Necrotizing fasciitis
                - A necrotizing ssti, necrosis of skin and subcutaneous tissue, and infection of deep fascia, often spread along the deep fascia
                - Infection in the fascial layer results in thrombosis of the vascular supply and adjacent nerve tissue. Destruction of these vital structures manifests as necrosis and anesthesia of the more superficial layers of skin.
                - Aetiology
                    - Type 1: Anaerobic bacterium (e.g. Bacterioides, Clostridium) _ facultative anaerobes 9e.g. streptococci, enterobacterales)
                        - Classically occurs after intra-abdominal or pelvic surgery before the days of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. May arise de novo in perineal areas (Fournier’s gangrene
                    - Type II: Caused by GAS, with or without involvement of other microbes
                    - Type III: Vibrio species, vibrio vulnificus, after exposure to water
                - Clinical features
                    - Early symptoms include fever, pain, oedema
                    - Skin changes: from red, to cyanotic and dusky back, reflecting full-thickness necrosis of the skin
                    - May develop septic shock
                    - Skin colour changes, and the sensitivity changes as well? Very tender at the spreading edge of the lesion, while central parts become anesthetic.
            - Clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene)
                - Involves necrosis of underlying muscle as well
                - Etiology
                    - Clostridium perfringens
                - Pathogenesis
                    - Muscle injury and cotamination with soil and other foreign materials containing clostridium perfringens spores, infection results in coagulative necrosis
                    - Virulence factor
                        - Toxin-mediated - alpha toxins
                - Clinical features
                    - Tense oedema, serosanguineous discharge, foul odour of the wound
                    - Subcutaneous emphysema - Gas pockets
                    - Systemic manifestations, septic shock
                - Diagnosis
                    - Gram smear of wound discharge: numerous g+ box like bacilli but few leukocytes
            - Surgical site infections
- [[Osteomyelitis]]
    - Infection of bone, an infectious process involving the various components of bone, periosteum, medullary cavity and cortical bone/ compact bone
    - Classified into acute osteomyelitis and chronic osteomyelitis, and prosthetic-associated osteomyelitis
    - Routes of infections
        - Acute osteomyelitis
            - Haematogenous osteomyelitis - usually arises from a pyogenic skin infections, that results in bacteremia
                - For acute vertebral osteomyelitis, usually 2 adjacent vertebrae and intervertebral disc is affected, due to the organization of blood supply to the vertebral column

            - Contiguous focus osteomyelitis
        - Chronic osteomyelitis results from untreated or poorly treated acute osteoarthritis
        - Prosthetic associated osteoarthritis
            - An important complication of joint replacement surgery, direct innoculation or spread from post-operative surgical site infection
            - Sometimes spread by hematogenous spread
    - Etiology of osteoarthritis
        - Etiology of acute osteoarthritis
            - Haematogenous monomicrobial
                - Depends on age
                - Neonates - S. aureus, GBS (agalactiae), E. Coli
                - Children > 1y - S. aureus, GBS, H. influenzae
                - Adults - S. aureus
            - Contiguous focus
                - Direct innoculation of pathogen to the bone by trauma, surgery, open fractures, or chronic soft tissue infections
                - Often polymicrobial
    - Pathogenesis
        - Acute inflammation results in the obliteration of vascular channels in the bone, resulting in ischaemia and necrosis, forming a sequestrum (Avascular piece of infected bone). when form sequestrum, is already chronic osteomyelitis
        - Subperiosteal extension of infection results in lifting of periosteum way from bone, resulting in new bone formation.
        - Ischaemic segments of bone separated to form the sequestrum
    - Clinical features of osteomyelitis
        - Acute osteomyelitis
            - Local pain and swelling, fever, chills and leukocytosis
            - Minimal or non-specific in some patients, e.g. infants or IV drug addicts
        - Chronic osteomyelitis
            - Chronic pain and draining fistula (sinus tract) (on the skin)
            - n chronic osteomyelitis, necrosis of the bone occurs, and a sequestrum (an avascular piece of infected bone) can form at the site of the lesion ([Figure 70–2](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?bookid=3123&sectionid=262002230#levmedmicro17_ch70fg2)). Relapses tend to occur in chronic osteomyelitis more than in acute osteomyelitis, and surgical debridement, especially to remove sequestra, is important to minimize the risk of relapse.

    - Mycobacterium osteomyelitis
        - Chronic vertebral osteomyelitis
            - usually from haematogenous spread from primary infection, occasionally from contiguous lymphadenitis

    - Routes of infection
        - Haematogenous spread (most important)
        - Direct innoculation (surgery, trauma and bite wounds)
        - Contiguous spread from adjacent infected soft tissue or bone
    - Pathogenesis
        - Intra-articular inflammation, results in the destruction of articular cartilage.
    - Clinical features
