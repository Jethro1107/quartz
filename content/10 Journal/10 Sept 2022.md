- Arterial supply of the GI tract
    - The abdominal viscera/ abdominal part of the GI tract is supplied by three anterior branches of the abdominal aorta (T12): The 1) celiac artery, 2) superior mesenteric artery and 3) inferior mesenteric artery
    - The celiac artery supplies foregut derivatives:
        - Stomach
        - Spleen
        - Duodenum (up to proximal half of the descending part)
        - Liver
    - The superior mesenteric artery supplies midgut derivatives:
        - Distal half of descending part of duodenum
        - Jejunum
        - Ileum
        - Cecum (with appendix)
        - Ascending colon
        - Proximal 2/3 of transverse colon
    - The inferior mesenteric artery supplies hindgut derivatives:
        - The remaining part of the transverse colon
        - Descending colon
        - Sigmoid colon
        - Rectum
    - Main branches of the abdominal aorta
        - Abdominal aorta produces 3 anterior branches, 4 paired lateral branches and 4 paired posterior branches
        - 3 anterior branches:
            - Celiac trunk - Common hepatic artery (right), left gastric artery, splenic artery
            - Superior mesenteric artery
            - Inferior mesenteric artery
        - 4 paired lateral branches - inferior epigastric arteries, middle suprarenal arteries, renal arteries, and gonadal arteries
        - 4 paired posterior branches - 4 paired lumbar arteries
        - The abdominal aorta branches into the two common iliac arteries at L4
- Venous drainage of abdominal viscera
    - Venous drainage of abdominal viscera follows a similar pathway to the arterial supply of abdominal viscera
    - All venous blood of the abdominal blood drains into the hepatic portal system (but not for the abdominal wall
- Lymphatic drainage of abdominal vsicera
    - Foregut derivatives - Drains into celiac LN at celiac trunk
    - Midgut derivatives - Drains into Superior mesenteric LN
    - Hindgut derivatives - Drains into inferior mesenteric LN
    - Celiac LN, SMLN and drains into the intestinal trunk, which then drains into the cisterna chyli, a dilated portion of the lymphatic system below the diaphragm, which eventually drains into thoracic duct
    - IMLN drains into the cisterna chyli via the left lumbar trunk instead

- Innervation of the abdominal viscera
    - Sympathetic division - Innervated by greater splanchnic nerve, lesser splanchnic nerve, least splanchnic nerve (aorticorenal, kidneys, suprarenal glands) and lumbar splanchnic nerves
        - Concept of splanchnic nerve - Splanchnic nerves are nerves containing preganglionic sympathetic fibres that has yet to synapse at the sympathetic chain ganglia, travelling via the splanchnic nerves to the abdominal ganglia, where they synapse
        - Foregut derivatives
            - Innervated by greater splanchnic nerve
        - Midgut derivatives
            - Innervated by lesser splanchnic nerve
        - Hindgut derivatives
            - Innervated by lumbar and sacral splanchnic nerve
    - Parasympathetic division - Innervated by the vagus nerve and pelvic splanchnic nerve (S2-S4)
- Anatomy of the oesophagus
    - The oesophagus is a 20-25cm tube that conveys food from the pharynx to the stomach.
    - The oesophagus is separated into the three parts: cervical, thoracic, and abdominal oesophagus.
    - There are 3 constrictions in the oesophagus:
        - At the cricoid cartilage - The inferior border of the cricoid cartilage defines the oesopahgeal inlet
        - At the aortic arch - where the aortic arch crosses the oesophagus
        - At the diaphragmatic crus (oesophageal hiatus at T10)
        - Clinical significance - The three constrictions of the oesophagus are the sites where foreign objects are most likely to lodge.
    - At the gastroesophageal junction (OGJ), overlaps the lower oesophageal sphincter.
    - The lower oesophageal sphincter is said to be a physiological sphincter, where diaphragmatic crus facilitates reflux prevention
    - Innervation of the oesophagus
        - Only thoracic and abdominal supplied by ANS due to presence of smooth muscles _Histology of oesophagus
        - Receives sympathetic innervation via splanchnic nerves arising from T2-T6
        - Parasympathetic innervation from vagus nerve - left → oesophageal plexus → anterior vagal branch, right → oesophageal plexus → posterior vagal branch
        - Oesophageal plexus - Bundles of nerves (axons only) on the surface of the oesophagus, consisting of fibres derived from the vagal nerves, splanchnic nerves from thoracic sympathetic trunk

    - Arterial supply of the oesophagus
        - Oesophageal branches from thoracic aorta, bronchial arteries and ascending part of left gastric artery
    - Venous drainage of the oesophagus
        - Venous drainage of the oesophagus via accessory hemiazygos veins, azygos veins and oesophageal branches to left gastric vein

- Anatomy of the stomach
    - The stomach consist of 4 regions:
        - The cardia - which is the opening of the oesophagus into the stomach
        - The fundus, the dome-shaped structure of the stomach above the level of the cardial oriface
        - The body - the largest portion of the stomach
        - The pyloric part - distal end of the stomach, separated into the antrum and the pylorus (L1 transpyloric plane)
    - Some distinct features of the stomach:
        - The greater and lesser curvature
    - The inner surface of the stomach consist of longitudinal folds (gastric rugae)
    - Blood supply of the stomach
        - The stomach, being a foregut derivative is supplied by the celiac trunk.
        - Note that _the celiac trunk gives rise to three main branches, where all are involved in supplying the stomach.
        - The first branch is the left gastric artery, which follows the lesser curvature of the stomach
        - The second branch, the common hepatic artery, gives off the right gastric artery that anastamose with the left gastric artery at the lesser curvature, a gastroduodenal artery that further drains into the right gastro-omental artery
        - The third branch is the splenic artery, which gives off the left gastro-omental artery, following the greater curvature of the stomach
        - Note the two anastamoses at the curvatures of the stomach
