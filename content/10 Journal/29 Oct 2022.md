    - Clinical history and symptomatology is the most important aspect in building a differential diagnosis and ruling out certain diseases.
        - When taking a history, start with chief compaint: Usually would be joint pain.
        - Rule out musculoskeletal emergencies - especially infection or sepsis.
            - A history of high-grade fever, weight loss, malaise points towards Septic arthritis
            - On PE, a hot and swollen joint could be indicative of infection or septic arthritis, but can also indicate inflammatory joint disorders, e.g. RA.
        - History of complaint (Joint pain in this case)
            - Number of joints involved, symmetry, which joint affected â†’ can narrow down ddx
            - Time of onset, and duration?
                - OA usually aggrevated by motion and weightbearing activities
                - RA usually aggrevated by immobility, **********************************morning stiffness**********************************
            - Acute or chronic
            - Temporal involvement of joint pain
