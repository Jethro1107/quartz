- Gastric pits and gastric glands
    - The simple columnar epithelium of the mucosa of the stomach invaginates into the lamina propria to form gastric pits, which branch into branched, tubular glands (compound tubular by IAS27?) that extend throughout the thickness of the lamina propria
    - The gastric pits and gastric glands consist of 5 functional cell types:
        - Surface mucous cells
            - The surface mucous cells line the surface of the stomach and the gastric pits
            - Histologically, they appear as a typical mucous-secreting cell, i.e. columnar, nucleus at base and a pale-staining mucous cap consisting of mucinogen granules.
            - They secret highly alkali insoluble mucous which lines the stomach, which 1) protects against abraision, and 2) protects the stomach wall from acidic gastric juice
        - Neck mucous cells
            - Neck mucous cells are found in the neck/region of the gland, they can be considered as the immature surface mucous cell
            - Histologically, they appear in clusters, or as single cells which assume the appearance of a typical mucous-secreting cells, i.e. round nuclei at base and a pale-staining apical mucous cap.
            - They release less alkali mucous
        - Parietal (oxyntic) cells
            - Parietal oxyntic cells are found in the neck region of the gland
            - Histologically, they assume ‘fried-egg’ appearance, large, round cell with centrally located nucleus and highly eosinophilic cytoplasm (as a result of abundant mitochondria

            - They function to release hydrochloric acid and gastric intrinsic factor.
            - Parietal cell secretory activity is stimulated both by parasympathetic innervation and by paracrine release of histamine and the polypeptide **gastrin**
             from enteroendocrine cells.
        - Chief (zymogenic) cells
            - Chief cells are located mainly at the base region of the glands
            - Histologically, chief cells assume the typical phenotype of a protein-secreting cell, i.e. basophilic at the basal region (due to abundant rER) and eosinophilic at the apical region (due to presence of zymogen granules
            - Chief cells function to release pepsinogen
        - Enteroendocrine cells
            - Located mainly at base
            - Histologically, unable to identify in routine H&E staining, but can be identified in silver staining
            - Function to release hormones or neurotransmitters to the lamina propria and blood vessels
    - The gastric gland structure varies among different regions of the stomach:
        - Cardia
            - Abrupt change in epithelium
            - Made of coiled branched tubular glands
            - Mainly consist of mucous cells
        - Fundus and Body
            - Relatively short gastric pits and long, branched tubular glands
            - Abundunt in parietal cells and chief cells
        - Pylorus (pyloric gland)
            - The pylorus consist of the longest gastric pits and the short, coiled, branched tubular glands
            - They mainly consist of mucous cells, and only consist of few parietal and chief cells
