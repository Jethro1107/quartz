## Respiratory examination

### Inspection

Head - Look at conjunctiva for pallor, Look at tongue for central cyanosis

Hands - Clubbing of fingers

Pick up hand from the side and observe from the side:

1. Any abnormal curvature of nail plate
2. Any abnormal angle in the nail bed and nail plate
3. Any floating sensation by pressing on base of nail bed
4. Any drumstick appearance of nail bed?

Legs - Pitting oedema

Press at level anterior of medial melleolus to observe for pitting oedema

If pitting oedema is present, progress up the leg to detect level of pitting oedema

Neck - cervical lymphadenopathy

![[Untitled 1]]

Approach patient from the back

submental lymph nodes, submandibular lymph nodes, preauricular, postauricular

Uper cervical, middle cervical, lower cervical

Supraclavicular fossa (ask patient to elevate the shoulders - supraclavicular LN

Chest - chest wall deformities, any scars (mid sternal, axillary regions especially for thoracotemy scars), pigment

Also ask patient to take in deep breath to observe for chest deformities and any assymetrical expansion

Then note respiratory rate (15 secs) - 12-16 is normal

### Palpation

Tracheal position central or not (further look up this)

Apex beat - Lowest and most lateral part of apex beat

Then from sternal angle, locate its position

Chest expansion

![[Untitled 1]]

Observe for movement of thumb

Tactile fremitus - use medial end of hand and place on intercostal space, then ask patient to say 1,2,3 softly, checking each side and proceeding inferiorly

### Percussion (always start at expected normal side)

Start at apex, then directly percuss the clavicle, then proceed down the intercostal spaces

Proceed laterally to avoid cardiac dullness

![[Untitled 1]]

Use swing action of wrist, rather than moving entire arm up and down

Normal lung should be resonant, abnormality → Dullness

### Auscultation

Anterior: Apex → Down intercostal space

Proceed down and laterally to the axillary regions (avoid cardiac)

Diaphragm or bell?

Vocal resonance (soft 1,2,3) - any reduced tactile fremitus (indicate consolidation or collapsed lungs)

On percussion, both fluids and solids yield dullness

Accessing tactile fremitus enables us to differentiate whether there is effusion or consolidation has consolidation results in increased vibrations and effusion results in decreased vibrations

Also while clubbing often reveals underlying hypoxia, hypoxia does not cause clubbing. However, things that cause clubbing also happen to cause hypoxia.

Clubbing - due to tissue fibrosis beneath nail plate that pushes on the lovibond angle
