- [[Axilla]]
    - The axilla is the gateway to the upper limb, providing an area of transition between the neck and the arm.
    - The axilla is a region that is defined as a 4-sided pyramidal shape, whith 4 sides, an inlet and a floor (base)
    - The axilla inlet is a roughly triangular shape with its apex lying laterally:
        - Its medial margin is the lateral surface of the 1st rib
        - Its anterior margin is the posterior surface of the clavicle
        - Its posterior margin is the superior border of the scapulae, up to the level of the coracoid process
    - The axillar inlet conveys major structures that pass from the neck into the axil.
    - Major vessels cross the lateral border of rib I and through the axillary inlet:
        - Subclavian artery - It crosses the lateral border of rib I and is renamed as the axillary artery
        - Axillary vein - It crosses the lateral border of rib I and is renamed the subclavian vein in the neck
        - At the axillary inlet, the axillary vein is anterior to the axilary artery, which is anterior to the trunks of the brachial plexus (the convergence of the roots).
    - The anterior wall of the axilla is marked by the superficial Pectoralis major, deep to it, the Pectoralis minor and the associated subclavius
        - The clavicopectoral fascia is a sheet of connective tissue that connEcts the clavicle to the floor of the axilla
    - The medial wall of the axilla consist of the upper thoracic wall (ribs and the intercostal tissues) and the seratus anterior muscle, note that the long scapular nerve descends along the medial wall of the axilla.
    - The lateral wall of the axilla is made entirely of the intertubercular groove of the humerus, and serves as the attachment of the muscles that form the anterior axillary wall and the posterior axillary wall
    - The posterior wall of the axilla is made of:
        - The subscapularis
        - The distal ends of the latissimus dorsi and teres major
        - The proximal part of the long head of the tricip muscle
    - Note the presence of the branches of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus
    - The floor of the axilla is the armpit (fascia and dome of skin), supported by the clavicopectoral fascia
    - Contents of the axilla
        - Muscles - proximal parts of 2 arm: Biceps brachii and coracobrachialis
        - Axillary artery - A continuation of the subclavian artery as it crosses the lateral border of rib 1
