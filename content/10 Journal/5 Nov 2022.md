- Work on myotome of the upper limb
- NSAIDS
    - Salicylate
        - Aspirin, diflunisal
            - Aspirin is usually used as Antiplatelet, antipyretic and analgesic agents, it has anti-inflammatory effects at higher dose, but is associated with adverse effects
        - Salicylate toxicity
            - As salicylate cross the blood brain barrier, it tends to cause significant complications at higher doses
        - Precautions
            - Avoid in children with fever due to viral disease (associated with Reye’s syndrome)
            - Pre-existing conditions
                - Comprimised cardiac functions
                    - Due to vasodilator effect and increase in retention of Na+ and water
                    - Increase cardiac workload
                - Deficient clotting
                    - Hypothrombinemia, vitamin K
                - Gout
            - Medication
                - Uricosuric agents
                - Penicillin
                - Compete for OAT system, such that they cannot be excreted
                - Particularly for uricosuric agents, which is required to be in PCT to perform its functions, thus salicylate reduce efficacy of uricosuric agents
        - Diflunisal 主要消炎，止痛
            - Outlier of salicylate
                - V. good antiinflammatory effect, better than aspirin
                - No salicylate toxicity (as it does not cross the blood brain barrier)
                - Relatively more cox-2 selective than aspirin, hence less GI symptoms
                - But no antipyretic effect
    - Propionic acid
        - Ibuprofen and naproxen, higher cox-2 selectivity relative to aspirin, and lesser adverse effects
    - Acetic acid
        - Indomethacin (Greater toxicity, and more upper GI disturbances)
        - Sulindac (Longer half life
        - Tolmetin
    - Oxicams
        - Piroxicam (Longer half life)
    - Fenamate
        - Meclofenamic acid
    - Selective COX-2 inhibitors
        - COX-1 has constituitive activity in platelets, GI tract and the kidneys, regulating physiological functions. Hence, Those drugs that are related with COX-1 inhibition is associated with adverse effects like GI disturbance, Renal insufficiency, and risk of bleeding
        - COX-2 on the other hand, tends to be inducible by inflammation, which means it is associated with less GI disturbance and bleeding factors. But is still involved in maintaining renal blood flow.
- [[Colchicine]]
    - Anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of acute gouty arthritis, and initially during the long term management of gout as a prophylaxis for preventing occurence of gouty flares with urate-lowering therapy
    - MOA of colchicine
        - Colchicine inhibits tubulin polymeralization, affecting microtubule functions within neutrophils. This prevents neutrophil migration into the joint.
        - It also inhibits LTB4 expression, resulting in decreased neutrophil chemotaxis.
        - Specific action to reduce phagocytosis of urate
    - Adverse effects
        - Commonly cause GI disturbance: Diarrhea, nausea, vomitting and abdominal pain, as it inhibits microtubules on the epithelial cells
        - Rare:
            - Hepatotoxicity and hepatic necrosis
            - DIC
            - AKI
            - Seizures
            - Hair loss
            - Bone marrow depression
        - Reduce dose, no intravascular injection
- [[Management of gout]]
    - Different stages of gout requires different managemet
        - In acute gouty arthrits, it is mainly managed with anti-inflammatory drugs, Colchicine, NSAIDs and Gluccocorticoids, IL-1 inhibitors
        - In long term management of gouty arthritis, the aim is to prevent the next acute gouty arthritis, i.e. slow disease progression of gout
            - Urate lowering therapy is used
            - Anti-inflammatory drugs (Colchicine, NSAIDs) during the initiation of the urate lowering therapy as urate-lowering agents can be used to avoid
