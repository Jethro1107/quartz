- New assessment format
    - Session A and B, basic science and clinical science, papers separate into MCQ and SAQ
    - no minicase
    - OSCA becomes mini-OSCAs, spread throughout the year
- Gross anatomy of the GI tract, liver and pancreas
    - Digestive system vs alimentary canal
        - DS = AC (oral oriface to anus) + Accessory organs
    - Oesophagus
        - 3 segments
            - small part of it is in Neck (cervical part)
            - Mainly in thorax (thoracic part)
            - Small part in the abdomen (abdominal part)
        - 3 constrictions - clinically relevant because they are the sites of foreign substances lodge
            - 1st at cricoid cartilage
            - 2nd at aortic arch (the arch is so large?)
            - 3rd at diaphragmatic crus
                
                ![[Untitled 1]]
                
        - Gastroesophageal junction
            - Squamocolumnar junction - abrupt change in histological features, marking the change between oesophagus and stomach
            - Watch again!
            - oesophageal sphincter is a physiological sphincter, no muscles to close it, crus of diaphragm contributes to reflux prevention
            - Hiatal hernia
                - Cardia of stomach protrudes through the hiatus into the mediastinum
                
                ![[Untitled 1]]
                
        - Clinical Significance of oesophagus - GERD, hiatal hernia, Barrett’s oesophagus
        - Venous drainage of oesophagus (GI02?) - most venous drainage of GI tract via hepatic portal vein
            - Liver problem - decrease return via portal vein, increased blood flow via venous plexus in eosophageal wall → Esophageal varices as a sign of liver disease
            
            ![[Untitled 1]]
            
        - Innervation of the oesophagus
            - Upper: Skeletal
            - Thoracic: Smooth + Skeletal
            - Abdominal: Smooth
            - Hence only thoracic and abdominal part is supplied by ANS (connect with embry, vagus nerve supplies structures derived from foregut and midgut
            - Sympathetic innervation: T2-6
            - Para - Vagus
            - Eosophageal plexus, bundle of nerves surounding eosophagus
            - *Refered pain* - Consider this dermatome map
                
                ![[Untitled 1]]
                
                - T2-T6 supplies anterior chest, hence oesophageal pain is detected by T2-T6 and thus results in referred pain to anterior chest
        - Lymph flow of eosophagus (GI02…)
    - Stomach
        - Transpyloric plane at L1
            - clinical significance: In imaging, vertebrae is visualised, to see if stomach is enlarged/displaced
        - Umbilicus is at L4
        - Isolated stomach
            - Cardia, Body, pyloric antrum, pyloric canal (pylorus is always fixed at L1 though)
            - Lesser curvature and greater curvature of the stomach
            - Inner surface of isolated stomach consist of gastric rugaes that facilates motion of food
        - Blood supply og the stomach
            - Stomach is supplied by the celiac trunk (All forgut structure is supplied by the celiac trunk)
            - Watch this slide again!!!!! missed the part how the celiac trunk splits
        - Innervation of stomach
            - Sympathetic - Greater splanchnic nerve (T5-9) (splanchnic refers to viscera, splanchnic nerves are nerves that arise from sympathetic chain ganglia … important concept…)
            - Paraympathetic - Vagus nerve
    - Small intestine
        - LUQ jejunum, RLQ ileum, duodenum C shaped, where first segment of duodenum is the transpyloric plane
        - Duodenum: 1st-4th part
            - Pyloric sphincter is an anatomical sphincter, not physiological
                
                ![[Untitled 1]]
                
                - Hence, on CT with contrast, the pylorus is black, as it is a real sphincter
            - First part (duodenal cap) - smooth folds, which then transitions into the circular folds in 2nd part
            
            ![[Untitled 1]]
            
            - Greater duodenal papilla and lesser duodenal papilla are the bile duct and pancreatic duct opening
        - Ileum and jejunum
            - Supplied by Superior messenteric artery and ileal
            - Jejunum consist of 1 rows of arcades and long vasa recta, while ileum consist of multiple arcades and short vasa recta
            
            ![[Untitled 1]]
            
            - Innervation
                - GreaterLesser splanchnic nerve (T10-11)
            - Lymph flow - intestinal lymphatic trunk → Cisterna chyli (collects chyli, think bio ch6 chyli i.e. lymph and fats)
    - Large intestine
        - Teniae coli are longitudinal bands of smooth muscles running along smooth muscle fibres, separating LI into haustras (pouches between teniae coli)
        - Omental appendices
        - Cecum -ileocecal valve
        - Appendix
            - Appendix supplied by its appendicular artery branching from SMA
        - Colon (ascending, transverse descending sigmoid)
            - Left and right colic flexures
            - Innervation of colon
                - 2/3 of transverse - vagus nerve
                - 1/3 of transverse + descending and sigmoid - pelvic splanchnic nerves
    - Liver and gallbladder
        - Liver - falciform ligament and round ligament (of diaghragm?) separates into the lobes of the liver?
        - When visualizing the liver posteriorly, caudate and quadrate lobe is also observed (sublobes of right lobe anatomically)
        - Porta hepatis (door to the liver, the horizontal line of H shape) is seen posteriorly, which consist of 3 major structures (hepatic triad):
            - Hepatic portal vein, hepatic artery and bile duct
            
            ![[Untitled 1]]
            
            - The vertical line of the H marks anatomically of IVC, gallbladder, ligamentum teres hepatis (remnant of umbilical vein), ligamentum venousum
        - Peritonial attachment of liver, only the BARE AREA is not attached via peritoneum
        - Lobes/segments of liver
            - Anatomically left and right, segments not required
    - Billiary system
        - Right and left hepatic duct are visible outside the liver, which fuse into the common hepatic duct, which is joined by the cystic duct, where it becomes common bile duct
        - Common bile duct fuses with pancreatic duct, where it enters 2nd part of duodenum via major duodenal papilla
        
        ![[Untitled 1]]
        
        Referred pain of gall bladder felt over right shoulder as it is located at inferior aspect of diaphragm, which is innervated by phrenic nerve (C3-5)
        
    - Pancreas
        
        ![[Untitled 1]]
        
        Head of pancreas consist of uncinated processes
