- Gait
    - Gait cycle
        - When walking, 60% stance, 40% swing phase
        - When running, 40% stance, 60% swing, new double float period
        - Mooreâ€™s clinically oriented anatomy
            - Stance phase
                - Starts with heel strike, when the heel strikes the ground, followed by the entire foot and assumes the body weight (loading response)
                - It then terminates with push off of the forefoot, a result of plantarflexion (gastronemius and soleus)
            - Swing phase begins after pushoff and ends with heel strikes
    - Prerequisites of normal gait
        - Stability in stance
        - Sufficient food clearance during swing
        - Appropriate swing phase pre-positioning of foot
        - Adequate step length
        - Energy conservation
- [[Neuromuscular blocking agents [[(NMB)]]]]  and LA
    - Curare revolutionised the practice of anaesthesia, used for muscle relaxation
    - NMB can cause aphyxia (unable to breath), which can subsequently cause death
    - Clinical use of NMB
        - Surgery
        - Rapid sequence induction - as laryngeal muscle relaxant to secure the airway in a short period of time
        - Critical care, ARDS (to prevent fighting ventilatory apparatus), Raised ICP (sedation), Therapeutic hypothermia (prevents shivering)
    - Classification of NMB
        - [[Depolarising NMB
            - Example of depolarizing NMB
                - Suxamethonium
            - MOA
                - Chemically, it consist of 2 ACh linked together
                - It binds to nicotinic ACh receptors, triggering membrane depolarization initially, which clinically results in fasisculation (A phase of contraction)
                - Persistent depolarization results in inactivation of vNa+ channels, which prevents propagation of action potential
                - This results in muscle relaxation
            - Clinical use of depolarizing NMB
                - Rapid onset, but short duration of action (15s of fasciculation followed by relaxation)
                - Used for rapid sequence induction
            - PK
                - Rapid onset, short duration of action
                - Rapidly hydrolysed by plasma pseudocholinesterase, only 10% reaches NMJ
                - Terminate of action occurs when it dissociates and diffuses out of NMJ
            - Adverse effects
                - Bradycardia - due to effects on ACh receptors on SA node (counteract with atropine)
                - Hyperkalaemia - as depolarization causes efflux of K+ into ECF(relatively less than influx of Na+ to maintain its depolarization effect, but still, causes hyperkaelemia)
                - Increase in intracranial pressure, intraocular pressure and intragastric pressure (as a result of muscle contraction)
                - Myalgia, masseter spasm
                - Anaphylaxis
                - Malignant hyperthermia: Rare autosomal dominant condition that results in hypermetabolic state: Muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, increased ETCO2 (end tidal co2)
        - Non-depolarizing NMB
            - Examples:
                - Classified by chemical structure
                    - Benztl-isoquinolinium and amino steroids
                - By duration of action
                    - short - Mivacurium
                    - Medium - Atracurium, Cisatracurium, Ro**curonium**, Ve**curonium**
                    - Long - Tubocurarine, Doxacurium, Pan**curonium**, Pipe**rcuronium**
            - MOA of non-depolarizing NMB
                - Serves as competitive antagonists, competitively binds to nicotinic ACh receptors in NMJ, but prevents it from opening.
                - This prevents generation and propagation of muscle action potential, thus resulting in muscle relaxation.

            - PK
            - Adverse effects
            - Reversal agents
                - Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors - Neostigmine (parenteral), pyridostigmine (oral)
                    - These inhibit AChE, enabling the NMB to remain within cleft for an increased duration of action
                    - Note that Pyridostigmine can be used for treatment of myasthesia gravis
                - Sugammadex
                    - Reversal agent for rocuronium
                    - Encapsulates rocuronium to form an inactive water complex, subsequently losing its action, and eventually excreted by the kidneys
        - Safe use of NMB
            - Required to prevent prolonged paralysis, by monitoring using peripheral nerve stimulator
            - Prevents accidental awareness during general anaesthesia (AAGA), by monitoring MAC for volatile Anaesthesia, and BIS (processed EEG to know whether they are sleeping) for volatile anaesthetics or IV anaesthetics

        - MOA of LA
            - LA after injection, diffuses intracellularly, where it blocks the voltage gated Na+ channels from the intracellular side
            - It raises the threshold for action potential, thus inhibiting the initiation and propagation of action potential
            - This blocks afferent nerve endings (sensory nerve fibres) involved in pain pathway
        - Classification
            - By chemical structure: Esters and amides

            - By Potency
                - Low potency - Procain, Chloroprocaine
                - Medium - cocaine, Lignocaine, Prilocaine, Mepivacaine
                - High - Tetracaine, Bupivacaine, Etidocaine
        - Factors affecting LA effects
            - Nerve
                - Type: first find to smaller unmyelinated C fibers, then type B (preganglionic sympathetic), then type A fibres (size C<B<A)
                - FIber orientation: Binds to outer periphery first, then proceeds to core of trunk
                - Fiber diameter: smaller fibres blocked first, larger fibres require more LA and 3 nodes of ranvier for effective blockade
                - Firing frequency - preferentially block the rapidly firing nerve fibres
            - Agent
                - Amount - determines local concentration and LA effect
                - Protein binding - Increased protein binding results in prolonged binding to Na+ channels, resulting in a longer duration of effect
                - Slower systemic absorption
                - Lipid solubility - Increase uptake through myelin sheath and plasma membrane
                - Degree of ionization -
            - Adjuncts
                - Adrenaline/epinephrine - Mediates vasoconstriction and prevents LA
                    - Cocaine has intrinsically vasoconstrictive effects while most LA vasodilates
                - Sodium bicarbonate - Alkalisation results in increased unionised fraction, resulting in faster onset
                - Hyaluronidase - promotes uptake into nerves
            - Patient
                - Age - neonaates (greater fraction excreted unchanged due to reduced metabolism)
                    - As we age, a1-acid glycoprotein reduced, so increase proportion of free drugs
                - Electrolyte - HyperK,
