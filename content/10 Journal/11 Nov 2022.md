- Molecular and genetic aspects of skeletal disorders
    - Mutations in genes associated with bone and cartilage ECM, results in altered biosynthesis and structural functions, a molecular consequence, that results in diseases (Osteochondrodysplasias)
    - Osteogenic imperfecta is a collagenopathy, but before underestanding the genetic and pathogenic mechanisms of OI, ******************************we must first understand (Type 1) [[Collagen synthesis]]*:
        - Collagen synthesis starts intracellularly, with the transcription and translation of COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes to produce alpha-1 and alpha-2 chains of collagen.
            - alpha-1 and 2 chains are characterised with a GLY-X-Y repeat, i.e. property of collagen is that it has a glycine every 3 amino acid residues. The gly-X-Y repeat, particularly Gly, the smallest amino acid known, enables the turn of the triple helix
        - Within the ER, 2 alpha-1 chains and 1 alpha-2 chains associate at the C-propeptides, followed by helical folding from the C-terminal to N-terminal like a zipper-like fashion, resulting in formation of a triple helix structure.
        - Simutaneous with triple helix formation, post-translational modification occurs at certain amino acid residues:
            - Hydroxylation of proline residues - Which provides formation of **********************intramolecular H bonds**********************, promoting helical stability
            - Hydroxylation of lysine residues - which enables formation of **********************intermolecular linking********************** for fibril cross-linking, or glycosylation
                - Hydroxylation of proline residues and lysine residues  is via the action of prolyl 4 hydroxylase, which requires Fe2+ as a cofactor. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid keeps Fe2+ reduced to sustain prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity.
            - Glycosylation of lysine residues
            - The extent of post-translational modification depends on the rate of triple helix zipping: The slower it zips, the greater the degree of post-translational modifiation.
        - They are then processed in the golgi complex into mature procollagen, which is then excreted into the extracellular matrix.
        - Extracellular processing involves:
            - Proteolytic processing, in which the C-propeptide and N-propeptide are cleaved, leaving the collagenous domain (triple helix).
            - Fibril assembly
                - Where collagen molecules aggregate into organised fibrils by formation of covalent corsslinked, reaction catalysed by peptidul lysine oxidase, which requires O2 and Cu2+
    - [[Osteogenesis Imperfecta]]  is the prototypical osteochondrodysplasia
        - Type I to IV OI are classified by the type of mutations in COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes. Type of mutation informs classification and pathogenesis.
        - Type I (mildest form of OI) ([[Different loss of function mutations underlie the pathogenesis of Type I Osteogenesis Imperfecta]])
            - Involves a loss of function mutation, that results in reduced amounts of type I collagen in bone (haploinsufficiency)
            - Mutation type: Nonsense mutation (premature termination) that results in loss of function
                - Nonsense mediated mRNA decay - no protein is formed
                - Truncating mutations
        - Type II (most severe form of OI) - [[Glycine mutations underlie the pathogenesis of Type II Osteogenesis Imperfecta]]
            - Associated with mutation in glycine codons of COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene
            - Glycine mutations acts as a kink for helix folding, allowing for more time for post-translational modification, resulting in excessive modification.
            - Results in a dominant-negative effect: a mutant chain is incorporated into collagen molecules, resulting in an overall abnormal collagen molecule, and when this abnormal collagen molecule is incorporated into fibrils, there may be altered cross linking and collagen packing.
    - Current treatment
        - Bisphosphonate therapy - inhiibits osteoclastic activity, having more inferior bone can beneficial than not having enough
        - Surgical corrections.

    - Diagnosis of OI
        - Traditional diagnostic assays: Sangar sequencing of COL1A1 and COL1A2 gene, gel electrophoresis of collagen obtained from bone biopsy
        - Next generation sequencing of 22 genes associated with OI, requires trio testing of parents of child to know whether it is autosomal dominant or resistance.
        - 90% diagnostic rate
            - Can miss some large indels, structural variants or non-coding varients
            - Also can miss mutations in genes not in the panel of candidate genes.
