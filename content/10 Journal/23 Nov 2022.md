    - [x]  Motility of GI tract
    - [ ]  Hopefully Somatic and autonomic reflex
- Motility of the GI tract (taking a look at guyton)
    - Motility of the GI tract is controlled in 2 ways:
        - Nervous control of GI motility - largely mediated by the enteric nervous system, which forms local reflex arcs, but is heavily influenced by autonomic nervous system
    - Swallowing
    - Nausea and [[Vomiting]]
        - Vomiting (emesis) is the active, forceful expulsion of gastric contents from the stomach, aimed at eliminating noxious agents
        - The key site in the mediation of vomiting is the brainstem is the brainstem dorsal vagal complex, which comprise of:
            - Area postrema (i.e. the CTZ) that is located in the floor of the 4th ventricle, and is outside the blood brain barrier
            - NTS, specifically, its medialy subnucleus, the key integrative site for CNS modulation of the vomiting reflex
            - DMX, mediates motor function of the GI tract in the process of vomiting
        - NTS receives signals from:
            - CTZ - stimulated by 55HT3, DA2, NK1 and blood born emetics
            - Brainstem vestibular nuclei, receives signals from vestibular apparatus in the inner ear related to motion sickness (in medulla and pons, consist of H1 receptors)
            - Higher centres, cerebral cortex and limbic systems, signals NTS via muscarinic receptors
        - The vomiting centre then coordinates motor response mediated by autonomic nerve fibres and somatic nerve fibres
            - 2 phases of vomiting
                - Podomal phase - Relaxation of gastric muscles, followed by retrograde peristalsis of intestinal contents of stomach (vagal mediated)
                - Ejection phase - Comprise of retching and expulsion of gastric of gastric contents
                    - Deep inspiration, diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, regulated by somatic spinal nerves, abdominal muscles contract, both results in increase in intragastric pressure
                    - Force out gastric contents
                - Simutaneously, the glottis, epiglottis, soft palate rises to close the airway
                - Hypersalivation results release of alkaline mucous to neutralize acid contents to protect the teeth.
    - [[Gastric motor functions]]
        - In the fast state (no food), gastric smooth muscle activity is referred to a cycle called the migrating motor complex, a cycle of contractile activity by the stomach that lasts for 90-120 minutes.
            - The MMC consist of 3 phases:
                - Phase 1: Little to no contractile activity, the quiescent phase - 60m
                - Phase 2: Random intermittent contractions - 20-30% of cycle
                - Phase 3: Regular high-amplitude contractions occurs at a rate of 3/min
            - These phasic contractions, are mediated by slow, intrinsic electrical activities along the membrane of smooth muscle fibres: Slow waves. Particularly, in the pacemaker cells called the interstital cells of Cajal that lie in the myenteric plexus along the greater curvature, at the junction of the Fundus and Body (E: [[Interstitial cells of Cajal generate slow potentials and spike potentials that mediate gastric motor functions]])
                - Note that these action potentials (generated in phase 3) is not propagated towards the fundus, but down the body to the atrum (via gap junctions between smooth muscle cells), to give propagating ring of contractions from the body to antrum
                - These force gastric contents down to the antrum
        - In the fed state, 3 neuromuscular activity occurs during and after ingestion of solid foods (see guyton: Ch64, part of motor functions of the stomach
            - [[Receptive relaxation of the stomach enables the stomach to function as a food reservoir]] (storage function of the stomach) - storage of the ingested food until the food can be processed in the stomach, duodenum and lower intestinal tract
                - Storage function of the stomach
                    - As food enters the stomach, it distends the stomach wall, which triggers a long vagovagal reflex
                    - The afferent vagal pathway stimulates the NTS and DMX, which stimulates the efferent vagal pathways.
                    - Efferent vagal pathways inhibit the excitatory neurons (that release ACh) and stimulate the inhibitory neurons (NO, VIP) in the gastric ENS.
                    - This enables subsequent reduction of muscle tone in the stomach, enabling it to accomodate greater and greater quantities of food to a limit in the completely relaxed state of stomach of 0.8 to 1.5L, while maintaining a low pressure in the stomach until the volume limit is reached.
            - [[Trituration - the mixing and propulsion of food in the stomach to give chyme]]  (mixing function of the stomach) - Mixing of food with gastric secretions until it forms a semifluid mixture called chyme
                - Trituration - Food mixing and propulsion in the stomach to give chyme
                    - It is mediated by slow waves formed by the ICC-MY at the greater potential, which reaches threshold for action potential.
                    - This results in propagation of action potential from the body to antrum, resulting in propagating rings of contraction, that occurs 3/min. This pushes gastric contents into the antrum
                    - As the pylorus remains closed (only a small porportion can pass into duodenum, i.e. pylorus discriminates food by size), the contents in the antrum becomes pressurised, and eventually squeezed upstream back towards the bod of the stomach, i.e. Retropulsion.
                    - The sheer created when the food move in opposite direction, is sufficient to break food down into smaller piece.
                    - Eventually, gastric contents forms a semifluid mixture called chyme
            - [[Gastric emptying]]  (emptying function of the stomach) - Slow, **********controlled (I added this word to Guytonâ€™s definition)**********, emptying of the chyme from the stomach into the duodenum at a rate suitable for proper digestion and absorption by the small intestine
                - Gastric emptying, the slow, controlled emptying of chyme into the duodenum, at a rate suitable for digestion and absorption by the small intestines. A controlled process, controlled by gastric factors (to a lesser extent) and intestinal factors (to a larger extent).
                - Gastric emptying requires pyloric pump and relaxation of pyloric sphincter
                    - Pyloric pump - Increased antral propagating rings of contracting that is of greater intensity than during trituration
                        - These intense constricting rings of contraction that extend antrally pinch/ squeeze through the pyloric opening into the duodenum
                    - The pyloric sphincter, made of the thickened inner circular muscle layer in the pylorus is normally tonically contracted to limit gastric emptying
                        - During gastric emptying, their degree of contraction may be influenced by gastric factors and intestinal factors
                - Gastric emptying is controlled, slow and regulated, to enhance digestion and absorption in the small intestine, regulated by gastric factors and intestinal factors (both involves nervous and hormonal control)
                    - [[Gastric factors promote gastric emptying]]
                        - Extent of stomach filling determines gastric emptying
                            - Increase in gastric volume, resulting in distension (stretch of gastric wall), triggers a local myenteric reflex that accentuate the pyloric pump, and reduce tone of pyoric sphincter
                        - Gastrin mediates gastric emptying
                            - (despite its effects on stimulating acid secretion), Gastrin released by G cells on distension (and maybe by partially digested proteins that indicate digestion is probably complete?), which vias circulation stimulate the motor functions of the body, particularly seems to accentuate the activity of the pyloric pump
                    - [[Intestinal factors inhibit gastric emptying]]
                        - Duodenal enterogastric reflex inhibits gastric emptying to ensure an optimal environment that enables digestion and absorption in the small intestine
                            - 3 Neural network
                                - Local feedback mechanism - within the ENS
                                - Long vagovagal feedback
                                
                                Essentially 2 effects, strongly inhibits the pyloric pump, and increase tone of pyloric sphincter.
                                
                            - Activated when there is
                                - distension of the chyme
                                - Acidity of the chyme
                                - Presence of any irritation of the duodenal mucosa
                                - Osmolality of the chyme (triggered by both hyper- and hypo-osmotic chyme)
                                - Presence of proteins, and to a lesser extent of factors
                            - These factors make sense:
                                - As they prevent too much of chyme being in the intestine
                                - When it is too acidic, it temporarily inhibits gastric emptying to allow for pancreatic secretions and duodenum to neutralize the chyme
                                - Osmolality of the chyme, prevents causing fluid or electrolyte imbalance in the body
                                - Proteins
                                    - Presence of proteins, temporarily inhibits gastric emptying to provide sufficient time for digestion.
                        - Intestinal hormones, particularly Cholecystokinin
                            - Presence of fatty chyme triggers release of cholecystokinin by I cells in the duodenal and upper jejunal mucosa, block increased gastric motility caused by gastrin, which results in inhibition of pyloric pump, inhibiting gastric emptying

- [[Reflex]]
    - Definition
        - A rapid, automatic and predictable response to specific stimulus, mediated by a typical reflex arc
            - Fast and sterotypical
        - A reflex arc is a neural pathway that coordinates a response to the instruction of motor neuron
    - Classification
        - Number of synapse: Monosynaptic, Polysnaptic
        - Innate or acquired (Physiological or psychological)
        - Spinal reflex vs cranial reflex
            - Spinal reflexes usually involve the spinal cord, and is involved in reflex in the limbs and trunk
            - Cranial reflex involves cranial nerves and the brain, and usually for stimuli received in head and neck
        - Somatic reflex or autoomic reflex
            - Depends on effector
                - Skeletal muscles, vs smooth/cardiac muscles and glands
    - Examples of somatic reflex
        - Proprioception - the perception of the relative position in our body
        - Stretch reflex and golgi tendon reflex
            - Physiological anatomy of the a muscle
                - Consist of extrafusal muscle fibres - which are contracted, and are innervated by alpha motor neurons (efferent)
                - Intrafusal muscle fibres - non-contractile, innervated by 1a and II sensory nerve fibres and gamma motor neurons (efferent)
                - Change in length in the intrafusal muscle fibres sends action potential via sensory nerve fibres to the spinal cord
            - [[Stretch reflex]]
                - Increase stretch of the muscle fibre, results in activation of intrafusal muscle fibres, and increases ap firing in 1a sensory nerve fibres
                - This activates alpha motor neuron within the same muscle fibre, and excites inhibitory motor neuron, thus results in reciprocal inhibition of  alpha motor neuron for the antagonist muscle
                - Also alpha-gamma co-activation
                    - Also gamma muscle fibres activated, shortening of intrafusal muscle fibres, enabling proprioceptors to maintain activity

                    Muscle tone is regulated by primary motor cortex via the alpha-gamma loop
                    
                - Examples:
                    - Knee jerk reflex
                    - Achilles reflex
                    - Biceps reflex,
                    - brachioradialis reflex
                    - Triceps reflex
            - [[Golgi tendon reflex]]
                - Protective reflex
                - Contracting muscles increase tension on tendon, activates golgi tendon organ, increasing rate of action potential in 1b sensory fibres
                    - Via a polysynaptic reflex in the spinal cord, via inhibitory interneurons inhibits alpha motor neuron to the agonist (same muscle)
                    - and via excitatory interneuron, stimulates alpha motor neuron to antagonist,
    - [[Upper motor neuron lesion and Lower motor neuron lesion]]
