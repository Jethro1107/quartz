- [[Spinothalamic pathway]]
	- Function
		- An ascending pathway for somatosensation, involved in detection of pain, temperature, and light touch
		- Receptors mediating these are thermoreceptors, or free nerve endings
	- Pathway
		- 1st order neurons (cell bodies within dorsal root ganglion) receives signals from thermoreceptors and nociceptors from various part of the body.
		- Central axons of 1st order neurons synapse with 2nd order neurons within the dordal horn
		- Where axons of 2nd order neuron immediate decussate through the anterior white commisure to the contralateral spinothalamic tract
		- Axon ascends along spinothalamic tract through the spinal cord and brainstem, and synapse with the 3rd order neurons in ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus
		- Axons of 3rd project to primary somatosensory cortex
- [[Spinocerebellar pathway]]
	- While normal somatosensory pathways are organised into 3 neuron system, the spinocerebellar pathway is organised into a 2 neuron system
	- Function
		- An ascending pathway for somatosensation involved in conveying proprioception to the cerebellum, from muscle spindles and golgi tendon organ, coordinating skeletal muscle activity
	- Pathways
		- Axons of 1st order neuron (cell bodies within the dorsal root ganglia) receive signals from muscle spindles and golgi tendon organs
- [[Receptive fields]]
	- Area monitored by a single receptor cell
	- [[Smaller size of receptive fields and lateral inhibition facilitates spatial discrimination and localisation of stimuli]]
		- The smaller size of receptive fields, the better it can localise the stimuli
		- Lateral inhibition plays a role in somatosensation, and special sensations to localise a stimuli.
			- Each receptive field is overlapped, such that stimulation of a receptive field would stimulate peripherally units
			- Maximally stimulated centre activates inhibitory interneurons that inhibit sorrounding neighboring units, enhancing contrast of signals between central and peripheral receptor fields
	- [[Two point discriminatory test demonstrates the effects of varying size of receptive fields and discriminatory touch]]
- [[Cranial nerves]]
	- [[Olfactory nerve (CN I)]]
		- Functional component
			- Pure special sensory for olfaction
				- Bipolar cells in the olfactory epithelium sends axons via the olfactory nerve, piercing through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone to the olfactory bulb,
				-  where it synapse with secondary olfactory cells (mitral cells and tufted cells).
				- The axons of secondary olfactory neurons pass through the olfactory tract
				- The axons may pass into the medial stria, which passes through anterior commissure to project to the contralateral olfactory structure
				- Axons may also pass via the lateral stria and projects to the ipsilateralprimary olfactory (piriform) cortex of the temporal lobe
		- Damage to olfactory nerve
			- Anosmia (loss of sense of smell)
	- [[Optic nerve (CN II)]]
		- Functional components of Optic nerve
			- Special sensory
		- Functions
			- Vision, and also partakes as the afferent pathway for the pupillary light reflex
		- Course
			- Originates from retinal ganglion cells, which receives signals from cones and rods via bipolar cells
			- Axons of the retinal ganglion cell sent through the olfactory nerve, which meet at the optic chiasm
			- Axons of medial retinal ganglion cells project cross the optic chiasm, and project via the contralateral optic tract to the contralateral lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus
			- Axons of lateral retinal ganglion cells project via the ipsilateral optic tract to the ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus
			- From there, optic radiation fibers run to the visual cortex
			- Some fibres enter pretectal portion of midbrain and participate in the pupillary light reflex
	- [[Occulomotor nerve (CN III)]]
		- Course
			- The occulomotor nerve emerges from the interpeduncular fossa of the midbrain. It passes between the posterior cerebral artery and the superior cerebellar artery, and continues into the cavernous sinus and passes into the orbital canal via the superior orbital fissure. 
		- Cranial nerve nuclei
			- Main occulomotor nucleus, situated ventral to the periaqueductal grey at the midbrain, at the level of the superior colliculus
			- Edinger-Wastphal nucleus, a parasympathetic nucleus, situated posterior to the the main occulomotor nucleus in the periaqueductal gray.
		- Functions:
			- Somatic motor component: eye movement, and elevation of eyelids
				- Innervates superior, inferior, medial rectus, and inferior oblique
				- Inervates levator palpebrae superioris
			- Visceral motor component: Efferent pathway for pupillary light reflex, and accomodation reflex
				- Preganglionic parasympathetic neurons in Edinger-Westphal nucleus forms axons that pass through the oculomotor nerves, synapse at ciliary ganglion, controlling sphincter of pupils and ciliary muscles.
