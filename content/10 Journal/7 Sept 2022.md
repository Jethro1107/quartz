- Histology of digestive glands (accessory glands of the alimentary canal)
    - Salivary glands
        - There are 3 major salivary glandsâ€¦ the parotid glands (anterior and inferior to the ear) the submandibular and sublingual glands (beneath the oral cavity)
        - The common histological architecture of salivary glands:
            - A capsule (CT?) that forms septa that extends into the parenchyma, separating the parenchyma into lobes and lobules
            - The parenchyma consist of 2 components: the secretory acini that produces the secretions, and the ductal system that delivers the secretions to the oral cavity
                - Secretory acini - 3 types
                    - Mucous acini
                    - Serous acini
                    - Serous demilunes - A cap of mucous glands superficial to mucous glands
                - Ductal system
                    - Ducts that deliver secretions to the oral cavity that progresses from intercalated ducts, striated ducts, interlobular ducts and interlobar ducts
                    - Intercalated ducts - lined with simple cuboidal cells
                    - Striated ducts, lied with simple columnar cells
                    - Interlobular and interlobar ducts progress from simple columnar to stratified cuboidal to stratified columnar
            - Distinct features of the main salivary glands
                - Parotid glands
                    - The largest salivary glands
                    - Consist of only serous acini
                    - Myoepithelial cells, sitting between the secretory acini cells and the basement membrane, contractile to aid secretion into the ductile system (present in all 3 glands)
                - Submandibular glands
                    - Mainly made of mucous acini, with some serous demilunes
                - Sublingual glands
                    - All three types seen, predominant serous demilunes
    - Pancreas
        - Histological features of the exocrine pancreas (release bicarbonate and enzymes in pancreatic juice for digestion)
            - Capsule with extended septa that extends into the parenchyma and separates the parenchyma into lobules
            - Parenchyma consist of pancreatic acini and the ductal system
                - Pancreatic acini cells assume the phenotype of enzyme secreting cells, eosinophilia at apical region, basophilic at basal region I.e. serous gland
                - Central acinar cells (located at centre of acinus) Have centrally located nucleus and
    - Liver
