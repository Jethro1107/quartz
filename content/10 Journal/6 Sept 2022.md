    - **Notes from 4 Sept**
    - Review of the bones that lie above, behind and below the abdominal cavity
        - Superiorly, bordered by the costal margin
        - Diaphragm forms the upper limit of the abdominal cavity
        - Posteriorly, lumber vertebrae, forms the bony framework of the posterior abdominal wall
        - Inferiorly, upper part of the bone of the pelvis
    - Layers of muscles and tendon that form the abdominal wall
        - Posterior abdominal muscles, along with lumbar vertebrae, and the diaphragm forms the posterior abdominal wallâ€¦ These muscles include the erector spinae muscle, the quadratus lumborum, the psoas major and the iliacus
            - Erector spinae muscle
                - Originates from the posterior part of the iliac crest and attaches along the posterior part of the vertebral column and the ribs
                - Surrounded by the thoracolumbar fascia
            - Quadratus lumborum
                - Originates from 12th rib and transverse process of the first 3 lumbar vertebrae
                - Inserts at the medial end of the iliac crest and transverse process of L5
                    
                    ![[Untitled 1]]
                    
            - Psaos and iliacus
                - Psaos lies medial to the quadratus lumborum, and lies lateral to the vertebral column
                
                ![[Untitled 1]]
                
                ![[Untitled 1]]
                
                - It originates from the transverse processes and intervertebral disc of lumbar vertebrae, and proceeeds inferolaterally and anteriorly along the pelvic brim
                - The iliacus lies lateral to the inferior part of the psaos major, where it originates from the iliac fossa and proceeds towards the inguinal canal
                
                ![[Untitled 1]]
                
                - The iliacus and the psaos major fuse together to form the iliopsaos, where it passes below the inguinal ligament and attaches to the lesser trochanter of the femur
                - The iliac and psaos is covered by the iliopsaos fascia, which is covered by the parietal peritoneum
                - The iliac and psaos functions to flexion of the hip joint
                
                ![[Untitled 1]]
                
    - Review of the lowest part of the abdominal wall, the inguinal region
        - The inguinal ligament
            - A tendinous structure from anterior superior iliac spine to pubic tubercle
            
            ![[Untitled 1]]
            
            Inguinal ligament forms the inguinal canal that enables the passage of the femoral VAN medially, the psaos and iliacus muscles laterally

    - Muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall
        - Muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall fill up the gap between the costal margins above, the edge of the thoracolumbar fascia behind, and the iliac crest, the inguinal ligament and the pubic crest below
        
        ![[Untitled 1]]
        
        - Rectus abdominis - run from lower anterior ribs to the pubis
            - originates from 5-7 costal cartilages and inserts at the pubic crests
            
            ![[Untitled 1]] ^e33306
            
            - produce flexion of the lumbar spine, antagonistic to erector spinae
            - surrounded by a rectus sheath
                - Posterior layer ends abruptly at the arcuate line, beneath it is a thin layer of fascia (deep to it is the peritoneum
                
                ![[Untitled 1]]
                
                Anterior layer of the rectus sheath is firmly attatched to tendinous intersections
                
        - Flat muscles - transversus abdominis, internal obliques and external abdominis
            - Transversus abdominis - originates from inner aspects of costal margin of 6th rib to 12th, between 12th rib and ileum, transversus abdominis arises from the thoracolumbar fascia, inferiorly, arises from inner aspect of iliac crest, and lower, arises from a thickening of the iliopsoas fascia
                
                ![[Untitled 1]]
                
            - Note transversus abdominis aponeurosis fuses with the aponeurosis of internal obliques to form one aponeurotic layer before it merges with linea alba
            - Internal oblique arises from the thoracolumbar fascia and iliac crest and at its lower ends arises from the iliopsoas fascia
                
                ![[Untitled 1]]
                
                - External oblique arises from the 5th to 12th rib
                
                functions: Increase intraabdominal pressure, enable lateral flexion of lumbar spine and rotation of thoracic spine
                
        - Aponeurosis - A kind of tendon that is in the form of a sheet
    - Inguinal canal
        - There is an opening of the external oblique aponeurosis, that is the superficial iguinal ring, its lower border is called the inferior crus, which is  atatched at the pubic tubercle, and uper border is called the superior crus, which is at the pubic crest
        - The superficial inguinal ring opens to the inguinal canal, where the spermatid cord and round ligament passes
        - The inguinal canal passes through the superficial inguinal ring, the free border of the internal oblique and the free border of the transferse oblique and the deep inguinal ring (the arch of the transversus abdominis
