    - Higher centres determine muscle tone by manipulationf of alpha-gamma loop in the stretch reflex
    - Upper motor neuron lesions results in disinhibition of gamma motor neurons, thus increase in activity of gamma motor neurons results in contraction of the two ends of a muscle fibre, stimulates the stretch receptor. Via the alph-gamma loop (stretch reflex), results in contraction of the muscle (increase in muscle tone), hence hypertonia.
    - This also results in hyperreflexia, and collectively spasticity.
    - UMN Syndrome
        - Muscle weakness
        - Spasticity
            - Defined as a hightened motor response to changes in muscle length (i.e. there is resistance to changes in muscle length)
            - The CNS UMN has a calming effect (inhibitor effect) on the stretch reflex by inhibition of gamma motor neuron (reducing the 1a sensory fibre responseâ€¦.
