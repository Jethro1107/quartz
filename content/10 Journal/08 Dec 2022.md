- Arterial supply of the brain
- ![[07 Dec 2022#^79800a]]
- Anterior circulation of the brain is afforded by the branches of the internal carotid arteries
	- Branches of internal carotid arteries include:
		- Anterior cerebral artery - runs in the interhemispheric fissure between the two cerebral artery, curving around the corpus callosum
			- It supplies the anterior, superior and medial part of cerebrum
		- Middle cerebral artery - runs in the lateral sulcus, with brain perforators (deep branch) that supplies deep structures (e.g. Lenticulostriate arteries)
		- Distal branch wrap laterally to supply lateral surfaces of the cerebral hemisphere
- Posterior circulation of the brain is afforded by the branches of the vertebrobacillar complex
	- Branches of the vertebral arteries include:
		- posterior inferior cerebellar artery, which gives posterior arteries 
		- anterior spinal artery
	- The two vertebral arteries unite to give a bacillar artery, which branches to give:
		- Anterior inferior cerebral artery
		- Brainstem perforators (pontine aa.)
		- Superior cerebellar artery
		- Posterior cerebral artery - wraps laterally around the midbrain and is joined by posterior communicating branch from the internal carotid artery
			- It supplies the posterior area of the cerebrum, more specifically, the inferolateral surface and medial surface of the temporal lobe, and the occipital lobe
- [[Arterial supply of the spinal cord]]
	- Supplied by vertebral arteries
- [[Brain circulation]]
	- Consist of anterior and posterior circulation
- Venous drainage of the brain 
	- Superficial and deep veins are bridging veins between the dural sinuses and
	- Superficial and deep veins emerge from the brain and pass into the subarachnoid space, where it passes through the arachnoid mater and inner meningeal dura and subsequently drain into the dural venous sinuses.... These superficial and deep venous system are tributaries of dural venous sinuses
	- Superficial veins include: superior cerebral veins, superficial middle cerebral veins, and inferior cerebral vein
	- Internal cerebral veins, Basal vein, Great vein of galen
- [[Dural venous sinus]] 
	- Superficial venous drainage into superior sagital sinus
	- Deep structures into Great vein of galen, into straight sinus, both eventualy drain into transverse-sigmoid sinus into internal jugular vein
