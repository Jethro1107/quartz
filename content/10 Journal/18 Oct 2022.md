- Brachial plexus and nerve distribution
    - The brachial plexus (C5-T1), is in close association with the phrenic nerve (C3-C5)
- There are 4 access points to the **************posterior scapular region**************, the suprascapular foramen, the quadrangular space, triangular space and triangular interval
- Branches of the posterior cord
    
    Five nerves originate from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus:
    
    - ▪
        
        the superior subscapular nerve,
        
    - ▪
        
        the thoracodorsal nerve,
        
    - ▪
        
        the inferior subscapular nerve,
        
    - ▪
        
        the axillary nerve, and
        
    - ▪
        
        the radial nerve ( [Fig. 7.53](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0350) ).
        
    
    All these nerves except the radial nerve innervate muscles associated with the shoulder region or the posterior wall of the axilla; the radial nerve passes into the arm and forearm.
    
    The superior subscapular, thoracodorsal, and inferior subscapular nerves originate sequentially from the posterior cord and pass directly into muscles associated with the posterior axillary wall ( [Fig. 7.56](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0365) ). The **superior subscapular nerve** is short and passes into and supplies the subscapularis muscle. The **thoracodorsal nerve** is the longest of these three nerves and passes vertically along the posterior axillary wall. It penetrates and innervates the latissimus dorsi muscle. The **inferior subscapular nerve** also passes inferiorly along the posterior axillary wall and innervates the subscapularis and teres major muscles.
    
    The **axillary nerve** originates from the posterior cord and passes inferiorly and laterally along the posterior wall to exit the axilla through the quadrangular space ( [Fig. 7.56](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0365) ). It passes posteriorly around the surgical neck of the humerus and innervates both the deltoid and teres minor muscles. A **superior lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm** originates from the axillary nerve after passing through the quadrangular space and loops around the posterior margin of the deltoid muscle to innervate skin in that region. The axillary nerve is accompanied by the posterior circumflex humeral artery.
    
    The **radial nerve** is the largest terminal branch of the posterior cord ( [Fig. 7.56](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0365) ). It passes out of the axilla and into the posterior compartment of the arm by passing through the triangular interval between the inferior border of the teres major muscle, the long head of the triceps brachii muscle, and the shaft of the humerus. It is accompanied through the triangular interval by the profunda brachii artery, which originates from the brachial artery in the anterior compartment of the arm. The radial nerve and its branches innervate:
    
    - ▪
        
        all muscles in the posterior compartments of the arm and forearm, and
        
    - ▪
        
        the skin on the posterior aspect of the arm and forearm, the lower lateral surface of the arm, and the dorsal lateral surface of the hand.
        
    
    The **posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm** ( **posterior brachial cutaneous nerve** ) originates from the radial nerve in the axilla and innervates skin on the posterior surface of the arm.

    • ▪ The **ulnar nerve** is a large terminal branch of the medial cord ( [Fig. 7.55](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0360) ). However, near its origin, it often receives a communicating branch from the lateral root of the median nerve originating from the lateral cord and carrying fibers from C7 (see [Fig. 5.73B](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0350) ). The ulnar nerve passes through the arm and forearm into the hand where it innervates all intrinsic muscles of the hand (except for the three thenar muscles and the two lateral lumbrical muscles). On passing through the forearm, branches of the ulnar nerve innervate the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle and the medial half of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle. The ulnar nerve innervates skin over the palmar surface of the little finger, medial half of the ring finger, and associated palm and wrist, and the skin over the dorsal surface of the medial part of the hand.
