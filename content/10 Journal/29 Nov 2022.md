- [[Bilirubin metabolism]]
    - Why should we learn [[Bilirubin metabolism]]? Because when interpreting an LFT, we musts **follow the bilirubin**
    - Jaundice is caused by elevated bilirubin (irrespective of direct or indirect)
        - Can be classified as pre-hepatic, hepatic and post-hepatic jaundice
        - Also called haemolytic, hepatocellular and cholestatic
        - Haemolytic results in increased unconjugated bilirubin
            - Other features: no bilirubinuria (as not soluble and is not excreted), hence no tea coloured urine
        - Hepatocellular results in increase in both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin
            - Other features: raised AST and ALT
            - 
        - Cholestatic results in increase in both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin
            - Other features: Raised GGT and ALP
            - Decreased in biliary excretion of bilirubin, hence less stercobillin and urobillinogen formed
            - THis results in pale-coloured stool
            - The conjugated bilirubin enters systemic circulation and is excreted by renal mechanisms, hence tea coloured urine.
- [[Liver function test]]
    - A series of blood test that test for different liver functions:
        - Albumin (synthetic functions)
        - Bilirubin (Total, direct and indirect) - excretory function
        - Parenchymal enzymes (ALT and AST) - hepatocellular injury
        - Ductal enzymes - biliary tract disease (but can be induced by drugs and alcohol)
