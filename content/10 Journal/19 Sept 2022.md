Donâ€™t learn anatomy for the sake of anatomy, it is much easier to correlate them with pathology

- e.g. common bile duct descends into the head of pancreas, therefore pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the head causes biliary obstruction and hence jaundice
- Intrahepatic billiary system not seen in CT, but if visible, that means it is dilated
- Pancreatic neck - in front of SMV and SMA, left of these vessels forms body and tail
- Resectability of pancreatic tumours depends on invasion into SMV and SMA
- Splenic artery just runs behind the pancreas, hence pancreatitis results in inflame and injury of SMV, SMA splenic artery
    - Complication - Splenic artery aneurysm, splenic vein thrombosis
