- 
    - Abdominal aorta → Common iliac artery → External iliac artery → Femoral artery → Popliteal artery → Anterior and posterior tibial artery, peroneal artery
    - Essentially, arterial supply of the lower limb starts with the [[Femoral artery]] , which is the continuation of the external iliac artery once it descends under the inguinal ligament at the mid-inguinal point
        - In the thigh
            - It emerges from the femoral triangle, it sits lateral and anterior to the vein, and medial to the femoral nerve (VAN medial to lateral)
            - It leaves the femoral triangle through a muscular space, the adductor canal
                - The adductor canal is bounded anteromedially (roof) by the sartorius, laterally by the vastus medialis, posteriorly by the adductor longus and adductor magnus
                - It conveys femoral artery and femoral vein, saphenous nerve, and the nerve to vastus medialis
            - It leaves the adductor canal through the adductor hiatus, a gap between the two insertions in the adductor magnus
            - Immediately as it emerges from the inguinal ligament, the femoral artery gives rise to the deep femoral artery:
                - Branches of deep femoral artery: Medial and lateral femoral circumflex arteries, which anastamose around the femoral neck and produces a retinacular artery that maintains blood supply to the femoral head.
                - 4 perforating arteries, which perforate the adductor muscles.
                - The femoral circumflex arteries and 1st perforating artery anastamose around the hip joint with the superior gluteal artery and inferior gluteal artery
                    - Provide connections between external iliac artery and internal iliac artery, collateral blood supply maintains blood supply to the lower limb when the external iliac artery is blocked.
            - When the femoral artery descends to the popliteal fossa, it is renamed as the [[Popliteal artery]]
                - Popliteal fossa:
                    - Superomedial semitendinosus, semimembranous,
                    - superolateral: Biceps femoris
                    - Inferomedial: Medial head of gastronemius
                    - Inferolateral: Lateral head of gastronemius
                    - Floor is formed by the popliteal surface of femur, popliteus, joint capsule of knee joint
                    - Roof is skin and fascia.
                - Popliteal artery, femoral artery and tibial arteries contribute to genicular anastamosis, maintaining blood supply to the leg when popliteal artery is blocked.
            - Once the popliteal artery descends into the leg, at the lower border of the popliteus, passing through the tendinous arch of the soleus, divides into the posterior tibial artery and anterior tibial artery.
        - [[Anterior tibial artery]]
            - A terminal branch of popliteal artery, which passes through a gap superior to the interosseous membrane and sits between the tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus
            - Distally in the foot, it is lateral to the TA tendon, and crossed by tendon of EHL.
            - In the ankle it becomes the dorsalis pedis muscle, which gives rise to the arcuate artery
        - [[Posterior tibial artery]]  descends in the posterior compartment of the leg. Gives a peroneal artery (branch)
            - The posterior tibial artery passes through the tarsal tunnel, “tom, dick and nervous harrry”, between the medial malleolus and the medial margin of the calcaneus
            - It reflects onto the plantar surface, to give the medial plantar arteries and lateral plantar arteries
            - Lateral plantar arteries gives rise to the plantar arch that gives rise to the
- [[Superficial veins of the lower limb]]
    - Great saphenous vein
        - The great saphenous vein starts anterior the medial maleolus, and ascends along the the medial aspect of leg and thigh, cutaneously.
        - It then passes through the saphenous opening (3-4cm below the pubic tubercle), and drains into the femoral vein.
    - Small saphenous vein
        - The small saphenous vein starts posteriorly, of the heal, and ascends along the posterior surface of the leg, and eventually drains into the popliteal vein.
- [[Bone]]
- [[Muscle dystrophies]]
    - A group of of muscle diseases with 3 common features:
        - They are hereditary
        - They are progressive
        - Each type of muscular dystrophy causes a characteristic, selective pattern of weakness
    - Dystrophinopathies: Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy
        - Pathogenesis of DMD and BMD
            - Both are caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene located on the p arm of the X chromosome (Xp21)
            - Dystrophin is an intracellular molecule, with one end teathered to the actin filament, and the other end teathered to membrane glycoprotein complex that anchors it to the extracellular matrix.
            - It stabilizes (maintains the shape and structure of muscle fibres) muscle fibres, preventing transient tears in the sarcolemma.
            - Defects will cause myofibril degeneration, outpacing the capacity of repair: hence the progressive weakness.
            - The mutation (genotype), correlates to extent of dystrophin deficiency, and hence the type of dystrophinopathies:
                - Indels, frameshift mutations generally result in DMD, while point mutations cause BMD
        - Natural history of DMD
            - At birth, boys with DMD shows no physical indication, by 1st year, it is still rare for any delay in development to be noticed.
            - From 18 months to 4 years, symptoms become evident, with clumsiness, and an inability to keep up with peers because of muscle weakness.
                - Progressive muscle weakness
                    - Initially at the pelvic girdle and pectoral girdle, followed by muscles of the upper limb and the trunk, and eventually involving other muscles.
                - By year 12, they tend to lose the ability to walk independently.
                - By 15-25 years, death tend to result from respiratory insufficiency, pneumonia and cardiac decompensation.
        - Natural history of BMD
            - Onset of symptoms much later, at around 7 years old.
            - Progression of muscle weakness is much slower than that observed in DMD, among BMD patients, progression at variable rates, with inability to walk ranging from 16-80 years
        - Investigation of DMD (in infants)
            - Blood tests:
                - Elevated CK levels (10 to 100 times in 1st decade of life, later in the natural history, CK will reduce as muscle mass is reduced)
            - Electromyopathy indicative of muscle weakness
            - Histological examination of myofibrils
                - Reveals smaller myofibrils
                - Withi increased endomysial fibrosis and fatty replacement as a repair process from myofibril degeneration) - hence more space between the muscle fibres
        - Diagnosis by:
            - Immunostaining
                - 1st antibody against dystrophin is added to the muscle biopsy,
                - Enzyme-labelled 2nd antibody against 1st antibody added to it
                - Colour development relative to the amount of dystrophin
            - Western blot - Gel electrophoresis of isolated dystrophin from muscle biiopsy, and compare the abundance and relative size of dystrophin.
            - Detection at DNA levels
                - PCR
                - Southern Blot
                - DNA sequencing
                - DNA chip
        - Treatment
            - No cure
            - Cure requires the restoration of normal dystrophin levels within skeletal and cardiac muscle fibres
            - iPSC therapy
            - Myoblast transfer
