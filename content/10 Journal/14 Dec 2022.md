- [[Pain and the pain pathway]]
	- Pain sensation is a special somatosensation
		- Definition of pain (nociception):
			- Pain is defined as an unplesant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.
			- By this definition, we isolate the 3 components of pain:
				- Unpleasant sensation: a particular the unplesant
				- Emotional experience: The ascending pathway also to the emotional compartments
				- Tissue damage (or potential tissue damage): pain is precipitated by noxious stimuli... Pain is a sensation that warns the individual to remove the noxious stimuli
		- [[Fast pain and slow pain and their qualities]]
			- Fast pain (Sharp, Initial)
				- Fast pain occurs immediately after the the pain stimulus, and only occurs in the skin (rarely in visceral tissues).
				- Qualities of fast pain: Sharp pain, pricking pain, acute pain, electrical pain
			- Slow pain (Delayed pain, dull pain)
				- Occurs around 1 second after the pain stimulus (often tissue dectruction), and increases in intensity
				- Qualities: Burning pain, crushing pain, throbbing pain, nauseous pain
			- Fast pain and slow pain is mediated by different conduction pathways
				- Fast pain by (relatively) faster delta Type-A fibres, and slow pain by slower small, unmyelinated Type-C fibres.
		- Pain is detected by [[Nociceptors]]
			- Nociceptors are non-specialised free nerve endings with two knds of afferent nerve fibres ([[Dual pathway for transmission of pain signals into the central nervous system underlies fast and slow pain]]):
				- type A delta fibres mediate fast pain
					- Glutamate as the only neurotransmitter
				- type C fibres ediate slow pain
					- Substance P and glutamate as the neurotransmitter
			- 3 types of nociceptors detected different stimuli
				- Mechanical (A delta)
				- Thermal (A delta)
				- Chemical stimuli (C)
		- Ascending pathways to the brain
			- For the links and trunk, they ascend via the lateral spinothalamic tract, synapse at the VPL nucleus of the thalamus, and projects to the primary somatosensory cortex (S1 cortex), and the secondary somatosensory cortex
			- For the pain sensations of the head and neck, they pass through the trigeminothalamic tract, which synapse at the VPM nucleus of the thalamus, and projects to the S1 and S2 cortex
			- This ascending pathway for discriminative aspects of pain (localisation concept of receptive fields, intensity and quality of pain)
			- 2nd order neurons also project to reticular formation, intralaminar thalamic nuclei, insula and cingulate cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus (all parts of limbic system), for affective aspects of pain
	- [[Pain sensitization]]
		- Pain sensitization refers to the decrease in threshold to pain stimulus of nociceptors (pain hypersensitivity) after tissue damage.
		- Physiological significance: It ensures minimal contact with the injured until healing is complete
		- Pain sensitzation may either result in allodynia or hyperalgesia
			- Allodynia: when normally innocuous stimuli is perceived as pain
			- Hyperalgesia: Increased painful sensation to noxious stimuli
		- Peripheral pain sensitization
			- Mechanism
				- Damaged cells release various chemicals that either activate or sensitize nociceptors (e.g. Bradykinin, Prostaglandin, Histamine, H+, 5-HT, ATP)
				- Nociceptor nerve endings also release substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) causes swelling, blood vessel dilation and histamine release by mast cells or neutrophils
				- Inflammation further sensitize nociceptors
		- Central pain sensitization
			- Mechanism
				- Inflammation triggers mast cells to release nerve growth factors, which is taken by nociceptors, that travels via retrograde transport to the cell body to induce expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is released at the axon
				- They increase secondary order neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord
	- [[Pain modulation by 2 pathways]]
		- Descending pain modulatory pathway activates the  opiate system
			- Signals from higher centres stimulate the midbrain periaqueductal gray to the medial nucleus raphe magnus of the medulla, which houses serotinergic neurons.
			- They send serotonerggic projects to the dorsal horn.
			- Noradrenergic locus ceruleus neurons dorsomedially of the pons send noradrenergic projections through the medulla to the dorsal horn
			- This essentially activate an opiate system within the dorsal horn: a collection of interneurons releasing enkephalin and endorphins:
				- Enkephalin and endorphins act on the the presynaptic membrane and postsynaptic membrane
				- It inhibits the release of glutamate and substance P from presynaptic nociceptors (inhibiting both C fibres and A delta fibres)
				- It causes hyperpolarizatio of postsynaptic second order neuron.
				- This blocks the relay of pain signals into the spinal cord.
		- Gate contral theory
			- It is discovered that activation of Type A beta fibres from skin tactile receptors can activate inhibitory neurons within the dorsal horn that inhibits 2nd order neurons of the pain pathway (a concept similar to lateral inhibition)
			- This is why skin rubbing near the painful area can result in pain relief.
