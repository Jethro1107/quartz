    - MSS PBL Case 1 LO: Physical examination for joint pathologies
        - You would rarely perform full physical examination of both upper limbs and lower limbs (kind of useless)
        - Clinical history and symptomatology is the most important aspect in building a differential diagnosis and ruling out certain diseases.
            - When taking a history, start with chief compaint: Usually would be joint pain.
            - Rule out musculoskeletal emergencies - especially infection or sepsis.
                - A history of high-grade fever, weight loss, malaise points towards Septic arthritis
                - On PE, a hot and swollen joint could be indicative of infection or septic arthritis, but can also indicate inflammatory joint disorders, e.g. RA.
            - History of complaint (Joint pain in this case)
                - Number of joints involved, symmetry, which joint affected → can narrow down ddx
                - Time of onset, and duration?
                    - OA usually aggrevated by motion and weightbearing activities
                    - RA usually aggrevated by immobility, **********************************morning stiffness**********************************
                - Acute or chronic
                - Temporal involvement of joint pain
                - Previous trauma?
                - Any extra-articular features
            - Family history - RA etc.
        - Physical examination
            - Most important part of physical examination is to establish whether there is effusion or synovitis. Presence of these tend to be indicative of infective or rheumatic diseases
                - Cardinal signs - redness, warmth over joint, soft tissue swelling, (pain)
            - Testing ROM is also important:
                - Palpation - Crepitus
        - [https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/monoarthritis-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation?search=physical examination of arthritis&source=search_result&selectedTitle=4~150&usage_type=default&display_rank=4](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/monoarthritis-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation?search=physical%20examination%20of%20arthritis&source=search_result&selectedTitle=4~150&usage_type=default&display_rank=4)
    - Joint pain
        - History of joint pain:
        - History of complaint:
            - Which joint is involved? - Certain joint pathologies specifically affect certain joints: OA - knee, hip, DIP joint of digits, RA, MCP of thumb, wrist, PIP of digits, Gout - 1st MTP
            - How many joints are involved?
                - Monoarticular (1 joint) - GOUT, SEPTIC ARTHRITIS, Spondyloarthritis, OA
                - Oligoarticular (2-4 joints) - Spondyloarthritis, RA, Systemic autoimmune disease, less likely to be gout or septic arthritis
                - Polyarthritis (≥ 5 joints) - RA, Systemic autoimmune diseases, Spondyloarthritis should be considered
            - Symmetry?
                - RA is symmetrical
                - Psoriatic arthritis can be both symmetrical and assymetrical
            - Back involvement?
                - Spondylitis
            - Acute or chronic (temporal involvement of joint pain)?
                - Acute cases - Gout, reactive arthritis, Septic arthritis
                    - Acute episodic - most crystal arthritis
                - Chronic joint pain (>6 weeks) - RA Spondyloarthritis, OA
                    - Progressive - OA
                    - Progressive with wax and wane - RA, other systemic autoimmune diseases, Spondyloarthritis
            - Extra-articular features?
                - Gouty tophi indicates gout
                - Plague psoriasis and nail dystrophy
                - Crohns disease
        - Physical examination
            - To distinguish between inflammatory and non-inflammatory joint disorders
                - The most important question: Is there effusion or synovitis?
                    - Hallmarks include: warmth, soft tissue swelling, redness
                - Less important, ROM
                    - Palpation → Crepitus OA
        - Investigations
            - Blood tests:
                - CBC
                - ESR
                - CRP
                - LFT, RFT
                - Serum uric acid levels
                - Serological studies - ANA (lupus), RF, ACPA (points towards RA)
                - Urinalysis
            - Radiological studies
                - X Rays is the mainstay for joint pathologies
                - Ultrasound detects synovitis and periarticular erosions
                - MRI usually for compression disorders
            - Synovial fluid analysis - suspect septic arthritis or crystal arthritis
                - Macroscopically, analyse colour, viscosity and turbidity.
                    - Low viscosity, high turbidity, and yellow synovial fluid indicative of inflammatory arthritis
                - Microscopically - analyze white count and neutrophil percentage
                    - Inflammatory - high white count with high proportion of neutrophils
                    - Polarized microscopy for crystal arthritis
                - Microbiological - gram stain and special stains (, culture
                - Non-inflammatory, haemorrhagic, inflammatory and septic types:
                    - Segregate by gross appearance, crystal analysis, white cell count and differentials, and microbiological studies
- Radiology in gastrointestinal system
    - [[AXR]]
        - Normal gas patterns
            - Stomach, usually present
            - For non distended bowels, small bowel can see 2-3 loops
            - Rectum and sigmoid colon normally present
            - 369 - the upper limits of caliber diameter of SB, colon and cecum
        - Fluid levels
            - Erect view
                - Stomach fluid levels usually present
                - 2-3 fluid levels possibles
                - Usually no fluid levels in bowel
            - Supine obviously no fluid levels
        - Features of GI tract
            - SB - Valvulae conniventes - circular mucosal folds, centrally located in abdomen
            - LB - Haustra, faeces, peripherally located
        - Plain AXR can almost be diagnostic of small bowel obstruction
            - Dilated SB (i.e. >3cm)
            - Multiple fluid levels >3 on erect view
            - Paucity (lack of colon gas)
        - Sigmoid volvolus diagnosis
            - Dilated sigmoid colon
            - Faeces present
        - Limitations of plain AXR, and the indications of barium studies
            - Cannot evaluate mucosa
            - CAnnot delineate level of obstruction
            - Barium studies - delineate obstruction and evaluate mucosa, demostrate motility and leaks
        - Barium swallow - For radiological studies of esophageal pathologies, double contrast, air (swallow baking soda crystals) to dilate bowel, and barium to create double contrast (mucosal lesions), while erect
        - Barium meal - Studies of stomach and duodenal pathologies. Similar procedure as Barium swallow but when drinking barium lie down on X-Ray couch
            - Replaced with Endoscopes, now merely a screening procedure before endoscope
        - Barium follow through - Studies small bowel pathologies
            - Laxative on evening before, fast for 6 hours before, following barium meal or swallow, ask patients to drink more barium until it reaches the colon
            - Another option: small bowel enema
                - A tube is inserted from nose or mouth to 4th part of duodenum, to inject barium contrast into small bowel
                - Better distention and delineation of small bowel than barium follow through
        - Barrium enema - studies large bowel pathologies
            - Laxative and clear fluid 1 ay before examination, colonic washout with tepid water on day of examination, i.e. Cleanse the colon of faecal material
            - Single contrast
            - Double contraste - barium then air to form a double contrast
    - Complications of barium studies
        - Perforation - peritonitis
        - Aspiration - relatively harmless
    
    - CT
        - Clinical significance of anatomical position of pancreas
            - Pancreas is retroperitoneal, and in close association with the superior mesenteric vessels and the splenic veins.
            - Pancreatic cancer resectability depends on whether there is superior mesenteric vessel invasion, or portal vein invasion
            - Whipple procedure (pancreatoduodenectomy) - resection of the the head of the pancreas, entire duodenum, gallbladder and bile duct - for treatment of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma
        - Clinical significance of liver
            - Liver receives dual blood supply - hepatic artery proper, and portal vein, union of the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein (hence on CT, we first see the portal vein, then followed by the 2 tributaries
            - 3 hepatic veins - right, middle and left, drains into IVC intrahepatic, Middle hepatic vein separates left and right lobe
            - CT of cirrhotic vs normal liver
                - Nodular liver (lumpy bumpy surfaces)
                - Portosystemic collateral pathways developed - recanalised umbilical vein in fissure for ligamentum teres
    - [[Branches of superior mesenteric artery]]
        - Runs in the root of mesentery of small intestine to the right of abdominal aorta
        - Superior mesenteric artery gives branches to intestinal aa., the ileocecal arteries (cecal and ileal branches), right colic artery, middle colic artery that supplies up to proximal 2/3 of the transverse colon
            - Intestinal arteries (15-18 jejunal and ileal arteries) - pass through the mesentery of small intestine
            - Middle colic artery - Ascends retroperitoneally and passes between the 2 transverse mesocolon, supplies proximal 2/3 of transverse colonI
            - Right colic artery - Crosses right retroperitoneally and supplies the ascending colon
            - Ileocecal artery - terminal branch of SMA, descends along the root of mesentery of small intestine, branches into a colic branch that supplies cecum and ascending colon, and a ileal branch, supplies terminal ileum, gives appendicular arteries
                - Appendicular arteries - branches of ileocecal arteries that pass through the mesoappendix to supply the appendix.
    - [[Branches of inferior mesenteric artery]]
        - Descends retroperitoneally to the left of abdominal aorta
        - Left colic artery, distal 1/3 of the transverse colon, sigmoid arteries, and the superior rectal arteries
            - Left colic artery - ascends retroperitoneally towards left descending colon supplies descending colon… Branches of left colic artery also supply distal parts of the transverse colon, but minimal blood supply resulting in splenic flexure being the watershed zone
            - Sigmoid arteries - passes retroperitoneally and pass through sigmoid mesocolon
            - Superior rectal artery
- Overall GI physiology (motility, secretion, function) should be studied from the 3 phases (cephalic, gastric and intestinal), and the secretalogues are released in phases
    - Follow the food…. Before the stomach, everything is mediated by ACh, In the stomach, it is regulated by gastric factors, In the intestine, everything is mediated by intestinal factors…
