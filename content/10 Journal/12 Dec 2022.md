- [[Thalamus]]
	- Thalamic nuclei
		- The thalamus is separated into the anterior part, medial part and the lateral part, which is separated by the lamina, while the lateral part is divided into the dorsal part and the ventral part
		- Anterior part
			- Houses anterior nucleus: receives sensory signals of mammilary body of fornix, and projects to cingulate gyrus
		- Medial part
			- mediodorsal nucleus: receives sensory signals from substantial nigra, ventral pallidum, olfactory cortex and amygdala, and projects to prefrontal cortex
		- Lateral part
			- Ventral part subdivides into ventral anterior nucleus, ventral lateral nucleus, and ventral posterior, which further subdivides into the VPL and VPM nucleus
			- Ventral anterior receives signals from Basal ganglia, then projects to premotor cortex
			- Ventral lateral nucleus receives sensory signals from cerebellu,, and projects to motor cortex
			- VPL nucleus receives signals from spinothalamic tract, medial lamniscus, while ventral posteromedial nucleus receives from trigeminal lamniscus. Projects to somatosensory cortex

	- ### Station 1: [[Ventricular system]]
		- ##### Components of ventricles
			- The ventricles commonly filled with CSF, consist of choroid plexus, and lined with ependyma
		- ##### 3rd ventricle
			- The 3rd ventricle lies between the 2 oval mass of gray matter, thalamus,i.e. the thalamus forms the walls of the 3rd ventricle.
			- But recall that the two thalamus is connected by the interthalamic adhesion, that essentially pass through a foramen bounded by the 3rd ventricle…
		- MRI of head often done… spaces filled with fluid will be white
	- ### Station 2: Motor nuclei
		- Recall from HNNS01, motor functions is mediated, at a high level, 3 areas: primary motor cortex, cerebellum, and [[Basal ganglia]]. In this station, the basal ganglia is the focus.
		- The basal ganglia consist of 5 nuclei:
			- • cuneate nucleus (closely associated with lateral ventricles) ^946b77
			- • Globus pallidus ^513bff
			- • Putamen
			- • Subthalamic nucleus in the subthalamus (diencephalon)
			- • Substantial niagra in midbrain
		- The cuneate nucleus, globus pallidus and putamen forms the striatum of the basal ganglia. Why? Because relatively anteriorly there are striations seen that connects these nuclei.
		- It should be noted that the internal capsule and external capsule encapsulates the structures of the basal ganglia.
	- ### Station 4: [[Cerebellum]] and it’s blood supply
		- ##### Associations of cerebellum with other structures
			- The cerebellum forms the roof of the 4th ventricle.
			- Superiorly, the cerebelar hemisphere separated from the cerebral hemisphere by the tentorium cerebeli, 
			- On its anterior surface, connected to the brainstem via peduncles.
		- ##### The isolated cerebellum and its surface anatomy
			- Orient yourself to view the cerebellum anteriorly and posteriorly.
		- ##### Anterior surface
		- ##### Separation of cerebellum in a vertical axis
			- The left and right cerebellar hemispheres and the vernus.
		- ##### **Separation of cerebellum in a horizontal axis**
			- Into superior lobe and inferior lobe by primary fissure (not that well demarcated, almost required estimation), then below the inferior lobe, is the frocullonodular lobe, defined by the level of frocullus and nodulus (vermis at level of frocullus).
		- ##### It’s vascular supply is provided by branches of the vertebrobasilar complex… (E: [[Branches of the vertebrobasilar complex provides arterial supply to the cerebellum]])
			- Superior cerebellar artery
			- Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA)
			- Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA and PICA syndrome) Brown sequard?
		- ##### **A key concept is that [[the vertebrobasillar complex divides the 3 components of brainstem]].**
