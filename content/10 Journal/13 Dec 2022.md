- Key concepts of the [[Cerebral hemisphere]]
	- The cerebral hemisphere is derived from the embryological tenencephalon, but to a large extent refers to the "big brain". 
	- Its surface is not flat, but with ridges named gyrus (pleural: gyri), and grooves named sulcus (pleural sulci). These gyruses and sulci are mainly involed in defining the [[Lobes of the cerebral hemisphere]].
	- At a high level, similar to anywhere of the [[Central nervous system]], the cerebral hemisphere is made of gray matter and white matter.
	- The cortex is the superficial layer of gray matter, much of which is hidden within the sulcus. Hence, we can say the gyruses and sulcus increase the surface area to accomodate more neurons.
	- The axons of the cerebral cortex essentially extend deep to the cerebral hemisphere, forming the white matter arranged like a fan (or a sweep) within, that is the corona radiata, and a vast majority extends into the internal capsule. 
	- Subcortical gray matter are also found, they are the basal ganglia and the thalamus.
	- The two cerebral hemisphere is separated from by the medial longitudinal fissure, housing the falx cerebri, associated dural venous sinuses, and deep to it the cinguate gyrus associated with learning and memory, that courses along the corpus callosum.
- [[Cortex]]
	- The cerebral cortex is the superficial layer of gray matter (housing the cell bodies) of the cerebrum, its surface are characterised by gyrus and sulcus.
	- These define the lobes of the cortex.
		- The lateral sulcus, described as the deepest, most conspicuous cleft on the lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere, divides the temporal lobe below, and the frontal and parietal lobe from above.
		- The temporal lobe overlies a cortical area deep to the lateral sulcus called the **insula**.
		- The central gyrus is best seen from the medial side of the cerebral hemisphere: Find the cigulate sulcus (on top of cingulate gyrus), as it extends anteroposteriorly, it gives off a marginal branch that becomes continuous with the central sulcus. *The central sulcus separates the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe*.
		- The parieto-occipital sulcus is also viewed on the medial side
			- It gives the calcarine sulcus of the occipital lobe that serves as the primary visual cortex.
		- The 3 temporal gyrus superior, middle and inferior can be found by placing the three fingers on its lateral surface.
		- within the longitudinal sulcus, one may find the transverse temporal gyrus.
- Much of the axons of the cortex forms the white matter of the cerebrum, they extend as a fan shape structure called the corona radiata, and into the internal capsule, and into the cerebral peduncle (of the midbrain), and into the optic radiation.
	- These descend to the spinal cord
- But some fibres run witin the cerebral hemisphere, e.g.
	- Arcuate fibres connect gyri within the same lobe
	- Longitudinal fasciculus connects frontal lobe to other cerebral lobes
- Note the corpus collosum is the white matter connecting the two cerebral hemispheres.
