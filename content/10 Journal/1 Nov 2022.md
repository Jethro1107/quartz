- Rheumatoid arthritis
    - Rheumatoid arthritis is a common, chronic, symmetrical polyarthritis. The commonest autoimmune inflammatory arthritis

    - Clinical courses
        - Usually manifests as a chronic symmetrical polyarthritis, usually involving the metacarpophalangeal joints and the PIP joints, metatarsophalangeal joints, elbows, knees
        - ACPA and RF usually positive, even before clinical disease
    - Pathogenesis
        - Environmental factor and genetic predisposition
        - 1st hit at mucosal levels, cause dendritic cells and APC to present citrullinated proteins to the lymphocytes, resulting in formation of ACPA.
        - 2nd hit at the joint, as minor joint trauma results in the increased expression of citrullinated proteins in the joints. This is largely due to Oc expressing enzymes that increase citrullination. ACPA can enter to attack these epitopes.
        - Macrophage infiltration → release proinflammatory cytokines, TNFalpha and IL-1. They trigger release of enzymes (Ptoyrsdrz) by synovial cells and also recruit circulating monocytes, accentuate macrophage iinfiltration. Extent of macrophage infiltration also determines the clinical activity of the disease. Hence TNF-alpha antagonist as bDMARDs proven benificial.
        - Pannus formation, granulation tissue, synovial cells, inflammatory cells cause death of cartilage, narrowing of joint space. May also bridge bone, fibrous ankylosis and ossified into bony ankylosis.
    - Pathology - Synovium  becomes  thickened, with papillary formation
    - Histopathology - Hyperplasia of synovium with polypoid, papillary fronds
        - Vascularised stroma
        - Dense inflammatory infiltrates, with plasma cells, lymphocytes
        - Together, a pannus, i.e. edematous synovium, granulation tissue, iflammatory cells that erode through the articular cartilage. Pannus can bridge through the bone to form a fibrous ankylosis, later ossify as bony ankylosis
        - ACPA activate:
            - Osteoclastic activity, periarticular erosions
            - Fibroblast activation synovial proliferation → Granulation tissue
            - RF against Fc portion of their own IgG (Fc portion the same in the same class), can also form immune complexes.
