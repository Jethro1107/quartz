- Evergreen
    - Got a HC event and will go out to get some work done
    - Productivity of the day greatly depends on whether I get my reviews done in transit time… but keep up the quality some time
    - Knew I had to go out today, which I’m grateful for, but that means quite a bit of wasted time, especially for evergreen note making
    - I don’t know what new topics I should focus on:
        - Treatment for osteoporosis? There is no lecture on osteoporosis
        - Gait cycle? I doubt how much it will appear in exams
        - What if i made it a review day today? Or focus on public health lectures?
    - [ ]  Drugs for osteoporosis
- Osteoporosis
    - A condition with low bone mas and microarchitectural disruption, with risk of fracture
    - Commonly associated with menopausal estrogen loss and aging
- Treatment for osteoporosis
    - Estrogen + Progestin
        - Estrogen and ESRMs can bind to estrogen receptors in bones, resulting in increased bone mineral density, especially after menopause.
        - Can also be used to treat ongoing postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms
        - Estrogen associated with breast cancer and cardiovascular disease, such that it is limited use case
    - Selective estradiol receptor modulator (SERMS) e.g. raloxifene
        - Binds to estrogen receptors in bones, resulting in increased bone mineral density
        - Alternative to hormone replacement therapy, does not activate estrogen receptors in the breast, hence, no risk of breast cancer
        - However, increased risk for venous thromboembolic disease (contraindicated with clotting risk)
        - Worsens postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms
    - Clacium
    - Vitamin D and its analogs
    - Calcitonin
    - But by and large, the aformentioned drugs rarely used for treatment of osteoporosis
        - [[Bisphosphonate]]  - pyrophosphate analogs (e.g. aledronate risedronate, ibandronate)
            - MOA
                - Antiresporptive agents
                - Binds to bone matrix, results in increased osteoclast apoptosis and inhibits osteoclast function, resulting in increased BMD
            - Pharmacokinetics
                - Limited oral bioavility
                - Taken with a full glass of water, while standing on an empty stomach, overnight fast at least 30 minutes before breakfast
            - Adverse effect
                - esophageal and gastrointestinal irritation
                - Musculoskeletal pain
                - Severe: Osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femoral fractures
            - Precautions:
                - Avoided in pregnancy and growing children
                - Oral formulation contraindicated in esophageal or upper GI disorders, or comorbidities inhibiting prolonged standing
                - Caution with renal insufficiency
                - Accumulation of bone and released slowly
                - Prolonged suppression of bone resportion increases risk for atypical femoral fractures
        - [[Denosumab]]
            - MOA
                - Monoclonal antibody that binds to RANKL (receptor for activating NF-kappaB ligand), preventing binding of RANKL to RANK on precursor osteoclasts and mature osteoclasts, thus inhibiting osteoclast formation and activation, resulting in antiresorptive effects
            - Clinical use of Denosumab
                - Monoclonal antibodies cannot be given orally
                - Given subcutaneously once every six month
            - Adverse effects of Denosumab
                - Hypocalcemia
                - Allergic reactions
                - Infections
                - Severe: Osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures (direct effects of prolonged suppression of bone resorption
        - [[PTH and PTHrP Analogue]]
            - Teriparatide and Abaloparatide
            - MOA
                - 1-34 PTH or PTHrP (1st 34 amino acids)
                    - Activates parathyroid hormone receptors
                    - Increase bone formation (an anabolic effect)… So this stimulates osteoblastic activities?
            - Adverse effect of PTH and PTHrP analogs
                - Injection site reaction (e.g. pain)
                - Nausea
                - leg cramp
                - Hypercalcemia (due to activation of PTH receptors elsewhere
                - Increased risk of osteosarcoma
                    - therapy limited to no more than two years
                    - Only used for those refractory to bisphosphonate or at serious risk of fracture
            - Contraindicated with associations of osteosarcoma
                - children with open epiphyses
                - Patients with bone metastases
                - Prior radiation of the skeleton
                - Elevation of ALP of skeletal origin
        - [[Romosozumab]]
            - MOA
                - Hmab that binds to and inhibits sclerostin
                    - Increase bone formation, decrease bone resorption
            - Clinical use
                - refractory to bisphosphonate or have high risk of fractures
                - SUbcutaneous injection monthly for a year
            - Adverse effects
                - Arthralgia, headaches, insomnia, paresthesia
                - Allergic reaction
                - Hypocalcaemia
                - Osteonecrosis of jaw, atypical femoral fractures
                - Increased risk of MI, stroke, cardiovascular death, contraindicated in those that has had an embolc event in the previous year
- Sclerostin
    - A molecule released by osteocytes to modulate bone turnover in response to mechanical unloading or oestrogen deficiency
    - It inhibits differentiation of mesenchymal cells or osteoprogenitor cells into osteoblasts, thus inhibiting bone formation (synthesis of bone matrix)
    - It stimulates the release of RANKL from osteocytes, which binds to RANK on precursor osteoclasts, thus forming mature osteoclasts and enabling osteoclast activity.
