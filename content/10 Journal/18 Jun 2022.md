- Grayâ€™s anatomy - thorax (notes taken with respect to contents in CPRS block)
    - Conceptual overview of the thorax
        - The thorax is a body region between the head and neck region and the abdominal region
        - The border of the thorax is determined by the thoracic wall, superiorly and inferiorly bounded by the superior thoracic aperture and the inferior thoracic aperture
        - Internally, the thorax is divided into:
            - The left and right pleural cavity (each enclosing each lungs)
            - The mediastinum
    - Functions of the thorax:
        - Breathing (ventilation)
            - Brought out by the diaphragm, the thoracic wall, the pleura and the lungs
        - Protection of internal organs
            - The heart, lungs and great vessels
            - The thoracic wall also protects some abdominal viscera
                - The liver, and kidneys (right protected by the rib 12, left protected by rib 11 and 12)
        - Conduit
            - As a conduit for gross structures, vasculature, nerves and lymphatics to move from one body region to another
            - Conduit
            - The mediastinum acts as a conduit for structures that pass completely through the thorax from one body region to another and for structures that connect organs in the thorax to other body regions.
            - The esophagus, vagus nerves, and thoracic duct pass through the mediastinum as they course between the abdomen and neck.
            - The phrenic nerves, which originate in the neck, also pass through the mediastinum to penetrate and supply the diaphragm.
            - Other structures such as the trachea, thoracic aorta, and superior vena cava course within the mediastinum en route to and from major visceral organs in the thorax.
    - Thoracic wall
        - The thoracic cage is part of a larger system in anatomy, the thorax, which consist of the superior thoracic aperture, the inferior thoracic aperture, the thoracic cage, the mediastinum and its associated structure and the two pleural cavities
        - The skeleton of the thoracic wall forms a osteocartilaginous thoracic cage, which includes:
            - 12 pairs of ribs and costal cartilages,
            - 12 thoracic vertebrae and intervertebral discs,
            - The sternum
        - Ribs
            - Ribs are classified by the nature of connection to the sternum
                - True ribs (1st-7th rib) - So called true ribs as they attach directly to the sternum through their own costal cartilages
                - False ribs (8th-10th rib) - So called as their costal cartilages do not attach directly to the sternum, but to the costal cartilage of the rib superior to them, such that their connection to the sternum is indirect
                - Floating ribs (11th-12th rib) - Their costal cartilage do not attach, not even indirectly to the sternum
            - Ribs are classified into typical ribs and atypical ribs
                - Typical ribs (3rd to 9th rib)
                    - See structure of a typical rib
                - Atypical ribs (1st, 2nd, 10th, 11th and 12th rib)
        - Sternum
            - Structure of the sternum
                - The sternum consist of 3 structures: the manubrium, the body and the xiphoid process
                - The Manubrium:
                    - 2 articular sites for the clavicles, i.e. clavicular notch separated by a crest called the jugular notch
                    - Lateral edges of manubrium consist of articulate facets for first rib (cartilaginous joint)
                    - Articulates to proximal end of the body at the manubriosternal joint (sternal angle)
                    - Articular demifacets for 2nd rib between the manubrium and body
                - The body:
                    - Consist of articular facets for 3rd to 7th rib (synovial joints)
                - Xiphoid process:
                    - Provides part of the articular facet for 7th rib
                    - Articulates to the distal end of the body at the xiphisternal joint
        - Ribs articulate anteriorly to the sternum
            
            Typical vs atypical ribs
            
        - Ribs articulate posteriorly to the vertebrae
            
            The two joints
            
        - Intercostal spaces
            - External intercostal muscles
                
                Inspiration
                
            - Internal intercostal muscles
                
                Expiration
                
            - Innermost intercostal muscles
                
                Expiration
                
            - Subcostalis
                
                Posterior chest wall
                
                Originates from a rib and spans mulitiple ribs, extending to the internal surface of the ribs below
                
                Depressing ribs
                
            - Transversus thoracis muscles
                
                Anterior chest wall
                
                Originates from the sternum and inserts on the costal cartilage of 3rd to 6th rib
