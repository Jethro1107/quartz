- HNNS16: Pathology of raised intracranial pressure and cerebrovascular disease
	- Raised intracranial pressure
		- [[Herniation is a sequelae of raised intracranial pressure]]
			- Herniation is the sequelae of a space occupying lesion in the brain
				- Defined as the displacement of brain parenchyma from one compartment into another
			- Types of hermination
				- Transtentorial herniation
					- Caused by a space occupying lesion in the medial aspects of the temporal lobe, that compresses on the free margin of the tentorium
					- It herniates from the lateral compartments into the posterior cranial fossa
					- Sequelae
						- 1. Compression of ipsilateral occulomotor nerve (motor defects), resulting in fixed and dilated pupils (blown pupils), specific defect is that the ipsilateral pupil cannot constrict no matter which eye is stimulated
						- 2. Compression of ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery, resulting in ischemia and infarction of the occipital lobe and the visual cortex, i.e. cortical blindness
						- 3. Herniation displaces the midbrain, and pushes the contralateral cerebral peduncle of the midbrain to the free margins of the contralateral tentorium, resulting in false localising sign, i.e. motor deficits ipsilateral of the lesion
						- Compression of midbrain and pons, resulting in loss of consciousness, depression of heart rate, change in respiration and elevated bp due to increased sympathetic actrivity
						- Compression of CSF circulation, resulting in hydrocephalus
						- Compression of optic nerve and retinal veins, resulting in papilloedema
				- Cerebellar tonsil herniation
				- Subfalcine herniation
- [[Internal capsule]] has an anterior limb, posterior limb and a genu (knee
	- CST descends along the posterior limb
- [[Cerebellum]]
	- Anatomy:
		- The two cerebellar hemispheres are joined at the midline, the vermis
		- Superior vermis is raised and inferior vermis forms a groove between the 2 cerebellum
		- Horizontally, the smaller anterior lobe and much larger posterior lobe is separated by the primary fissure
		- On the underside, a smaller region of hemisphere (flocullus), and associated level of vermis (nodulus) forms the flocculonodular lobe
	- Physiological anatomy
		- Two hemispheres joined at the midline
			- Vermis
			- Intermmediate hemisphere
			- Lateral hemisphere
			- Flocculonodular lobe
		- Cerebellar cortex, which consists of granule cells, purkinje cell layers, and a molecular layer
		- Underlying white matter
		- Subcortical cerebellar nuclei deep to white matter (Deep cerebellar nuclei)
			- Fastigial nucleus deep to vermis
			- Globose nucleus, Emboliform nucleus in intermediate hemisphere
			- Dentate nucleus in lateral hemisphere (very large)
		- Cerebellar peduncles
			- Middle cerebellar peduncle receives imput via mossy fibres from the pons
			- Inferior cerebellar peduncle receives imput via mossy fibres and climbing fibres from medulla and spinal cord
			- Superior cerebellar peduncle sends output to the thalamus, red nucleus and the vestibular nuclei
	- Cerebellar cortex circuitry
		- There are two afferent imput types
			- Mossy fibre imputs from various structures of the brain (braiin, brainstem, spinal cord)
			- Climbing fibre imputs from inferior olivary nucleus of the medulla.
			- Climbing fibre circuitry
				- Climbing fib
				- res from inferior olivary nucleus excite the purkinge cells
				- Purkinge cellls are normally inhibitory, resulting in inhibition deep cerebellar nuclei, or vestibular nuclei
			- Mossy fibre circuitry
				- Mossy fibres from various source stimulate granule cells, which then projects to the molecular layer, then bifurcates to give parallel nere fibres that synapse with some 40 pyramidal cells
				- Purkinge cells activated, and inhibit deep cerebellar nuclei or vestibular nuclei
				- The cool thing about mossy fibre circuitry, is that parallel fibres excites basket cells and stellate cells, with short fibres perpendicular to the long parallel fibres sent by granular cells
					- This results in lateral inhibition of P cells that are not on

- [[Anatomy of the head and neck]] ^d063ef
	- Using moore's clinically oriented anatomy as reference
	- Getting a break from neuroanatomy
	- The head is the superior part of the body that is separated from the trunk by the neck
		- Bony framework of the head
			- The skul forms the body framework of the head
			- The skull consists of the neurocranium, which combines with the viscerocranium (facial bones) to give the cranium, and the mandible
			![[Pasted image 20221217205455.png|300]]
		- [[Neurocranium]] (houses the brain, encloses the cranial cavity)
			- Calvaria
				- The calvaria forms the superior part of the neurocranium (roof of the cranial cavity)
				- It essentially consists of the frontal bobe, paired parietal bone, occipital bone
			- Cranial base (floor of the cranial cavity)
				- Formed by the paired temporal bone, paired sphenoid bone and paired ethmoid bone (forms a small part of the midline of the cranium, but essentially is part of the viscerocranium)
		- Viscerocranium
	- [[Temporal bone]]
		- The temporal bone is found on the lateral aspects of the cranium, and forms the neurocranial part.
		- It is characterised by the mastoid process, the external acoustic meatus opening, the styloid process, and the squamous part and the zygomatic process, the mastoid process of temporal bone, petrous process of temporal bone, and the tympanic plate
		- External (Lateral) features of the temporal bone:
			- Characterised by the squamous part, articulates with the greater wing of the sphenoid bone, and posteriorly, with the squamous part of the parietal bone
				- The squamous part consists of the zygomatic process
				- The squamous part extends medially to give the petrous part
					- inferiorly to give the styloid process
					- Posteriorly with the mastoid process
			- External acoustic meatus 
	- [[Sphenoid bone]]
	- The sphenoid bone is found on the lateral aspects of the cranium and forms part of the neurocranium
	- It articulates anteriorly to the ethmoid bone, and posteriorly to the occipital bone
	- It is an unpaired bone
	- It has the body, the lesser wing, the greater wing, the pterygoid process (which has a lateral pterygoid plate and a medial ptelygoid plate)
	- Greater wing articulates with the frontal bone, parietal bone, temporal bone and zygomatic bones
	- Feature:
		- Consist of the pterygomaxillary fissure between the greater wing, lateral pterygoid plate and the maxilla
		- Enclosing the pterygopalatine fossa, which houses the sphenopalatine foramen (entry of sphenopalatine artery), and pteryogopalatine ganglion
