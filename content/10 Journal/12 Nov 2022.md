- Marfans syndrome
    - Disease syndrome with pleiotropic manifestations with manifestations of many organs, in mutation of gene encoding for Fibrillin 1, which impairs ECM functions, particularly resulting in excessive TGFbeta signaling
    - In MSK, it is characterised with joint laxity and bone overgrowth
    - TGF-beta is trapped in ECM
        - TGF-beta and its propeptide, latency associated peptide (non-covalently associated), form small latency complex
        - LAP S-S bond to LTBP to form LLC, which is secreted by cells
        - LLC then binds to other ECM matrix, particularly Fibrillin
    - TGF-activation via:
        - MMP cleaves it from LAP (think peribronchial fibrosis in ECM
        - Direct Degradation of ECM
        - Conformational change to LAP:
            - RGD motif on LAP is recognised by aVbeta6 integrin in cells, through mechanical strains, resulting in corformational change of LAP that results in release of active TGF-beta
- Anatomy of the spine
    - Part of the back
    - [[Vertebral column]], consist of 33 vertebraes arranged in 5 regions, and associated intervertebral discs and ligaments
        - Cervical region - 7 cervical vertebrae
        - Thoracic - 12 thoracic vertebrae
        - Lumbar region - 5 lumbar vertebrae
        - Sacrum - 5 sacral vertebrae that fuse in adulthood
        - Coccyx - 4 Coccygeal vertebrae
        - The upper 24 vertebral bodies are movable, while the lower 9 vertebral bodies are immovable
    - [[Structure of a typical vertebrae]]
        - Consist of a vertebral body, vertebral arch and seven processes
        - Vertebral body - The massive, anterior, cylindrical bone.
            - It is a vascular, spongy bone, surrounded by a thin layer of compact bone. Highly active in haematopoiesis
            - Size of vertebral bodies increase as we move down the vertebral column, as each bears progressively greater body weight
            - On the posterior surface, one or more laminae foramina convey basivertebral veins that drain the marrow
        - Vertebral arch
            - Posterior to the vertebral body
            - Consist of 2 pedicles, short cylindrical processes that project posteriorly to meet the 2 laminae, 2 broad flat bones that extend posteromedially and unite at the midline.
            - The posterior surface of the vertebral body, the vertebral arch forms the vertebral foramen, where successions of vertebral foramen form a vertebral canal (spinal canal)
            - The spinal canal houses the spinal cord, and nerve roots, the meninges, adipose tissues, vessels etc.
            - Superior vertebral notch, IV disc and inferior vertebral notch encloses the intervertebral foramina, which houses the nerve roots and spinal ganglia
        - 7 spinal process
            - 1 spinous process which projects posteriorly (and usually inferiorly) from the junction of the laminae
            - 2 transverse process, which projects posterolaterally from the junction of the pedicle and laminae
            - 2 superior articular process, which projects superiorly from the junction of pedicles and laminae, bearing an articular facet to articulate with the inferior articular process
            - 2 inferior articular process, which projects inferiorly from the junction of pedicles and laminae, bearing an articular facet to articulate with the superior articular process
            - Spinous + transverse = muscle attachment, articular processes = intervertebral joints that determines types of movements permited.
    - While the each vertebrae is unique in its shape,
        - They tend to have certain features that is characteristic to the region (e.g. Transverse foraminae in transverse process is a characteristic feature of cervical vertebrae.
        - Certain vertebrae have distinguishing features: C7 vertebrae has the longest spinous process (vertebra prominens)
        - Also, in each region, the articular facets of articular processes,
    - Characteristic [[Features of cervical vertebrae]]
        - Vertebral body - rectangular shape with a concave superior surface, and a convex inferior surface
        - Transverse process - The most distinguishing feature of cervical vertebrae is the transverse foramen. The transverse process terminate laterally as 2 bony projections, the anterior and posterior tubercles, for muscle attachment of cervical muscles, i.e. levator scapulae and scalene muscles and inferiorly
            - The vertebral arteries and their accompanying veins pass through the transverse foramina, except those in C7, which transmit only small accessory veins. Thus, the foramina are smaller in C7 than those in other cervical vertebrae are, and occasionally they are absent.
        - Articular facets are relatively horizontal, directed superiorly and inferiorly (horizontal plane of joint?)
            - Enjoy a greater ROM, flexion, extension, lateral flexion
        - Spinous process
            - Bifid in C2 to C6, not in C7
            - C7 has the longest spinous process (vertebra prominens)
        - C3-C7 are considered as typical vertebrae - they have large vertebral foramina
        - C1 and C2 are atypical cervical vertebrae
            - C1: atlas
                - Ring shaped vertebrae that lacks a vertebral body and spinous process.
                - 2 lateral masses replace the vertebral bodies, that connect anteriorly and posteriorly by the anterior and posterior arch, each marked centrally by a tubercle. The posterior arch corresponds with the laminae in a typical vertebrae.
                - The lateral masses consist of a superior articular surface that articulates with the cranial prominences, the occipital condyles, at the atlantooccipital joints
                - Transverse process arise from the lateral masses
                - As the vertebral artery ascends through the C1 vertebral foramen, it courses medial, through a groove for the vertebral artery posterior to the lateral masses (on the posterior arch). C1 spinal nerves also pass through the same groove
                - Transverse ligament of the atlas extends between the 2 lateral masses, enclosing the socket that receives the dens of axis
            - C2: axis
                - C2 ressembles more like a typical vertebrae than the atlas, it has an additional structure:
                    - Dens/Odontoid process (projects superiorly from the body and inserts into the socket formed by the anterior arch and transverse ligament of atlas
                        - It serves as the pivot for lateral rotation
                - C1 and C2 articulate at 3 atlantoaxial joints
                    - Between the articular facets (plane joints)
                    - Between the dens and the anterior arch (pivot joint)
                    - Enables lateral rotation of the head, no movement
    - [[Features of thoracic vertebrae]]
        - Heart shaped vertebral body
        - Costal facets superiorly and inferiorly to articulate with ribs
        - Transverse processes, consist of artiular facets for tubercles of the ribs
        - Vertical facets, face posteriorly and anteriorly (Joints are coronarily oriented)
            - Enables lateral rotation
            - The vertical facets and the attachment of rib cage limit lateral flexion, flexion and extension
        - Spinous process - long, but projects posteroinferiorly, overlapping the inferior ones.
    - [[Features of lumbar vertebrae]]
        - Body - large kidney shape
        - Transverse process - long and slender, directing laterally
        - Articular facets - Vertical, sagitally oriented, facets face medially and laterally.
            - Enables flexion and extension
            - Some degree of lateral flexion
            - No rotation
        - Spinous process, broad, blunt, short
    - [[Features of Sacrum and Coccyx]]
        - Wedge shaped structure composed of 5 fused vertebrae
            - Posterosuperior wall of pelvic cavity
            - Transmits the weight of the body to leg through the hip joint (sacrum is not weight bearing)
            - Sacral canal
            - Four pairs of sacral foramina
                - The anterior and posterior sacral foramina, the exits and entry of ventral and dorsal rami of S1-S4 spinal nerves.
            - Sacral promotory - The anterior surface of S1
    -
