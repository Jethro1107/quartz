- Messi's immortality status
	- This changes nothing. As much as we wanted to think this changes everything, this changes nothing.
	- Pregame, we thought this was a career defining moment, seeing him lift the world cup trophy would cement him as the greatest of all time.
	- But that is not the case, there will never be the unanimous GOAT.
	- It will always be a debate between messi, ronaldo, maradona and pele, and hopefully in the future, new greats.
	- One tournament win doesn't change anything, even when its winning at the highest level of football.
	- 30-40 years from now, when we reflect on his career, this won't be the only moment we remember him for: It will be the 91 goals in a calender year, the winning goal against madrid in 2017, it will be the one booted goal against united, it will be his time as a false nine.
	- You can't define greatness by a single moment.
