- Neuroendocrine control of gastric acid secretion
    - Guyton - The three basic factors that stimulate gastric secretion are aetylcholine, gastrin and histamine
        - Acetylcholine stimulates gastric acid secretion by parietal cells, mucous secretion by mucous cells and pepsinogen secretion by chief cells
        - While the other factors mainly stimulate secretions by parietal cells, and have little effect over other cells, i.e. the chief cells (consider… regulation of pepsinogen secretion?) and mucous cells
    - So now I’ll consider the neuroendocrine stimulatory mechanisms of acid secretion
        - Acetylcholine via M3 muscarinic receptors
            - Parietal cells are directly stimulated by acetylcholine by cholinergic nerve endings of the enteric nervous system (submucosal plexus)
            - Acetylcholine also stimulates Enterochromaffin-like cells to release histamine
        - Histamine via H2 receptors
            - Note, histamine is synthesized by the amino acid histidine via the enzyme histidine decarboxylase
        - Gastrin from G cells in the pyloric glands, via cholecystokinin 2 (CCK2) receptors
            - It acts directly on parietal cells
            - It also acts indirectly on ECL cells, which is stimulated to release histamine
        - Gherin released by X cells stimulates the vagal afferent pathway, stimulates NTS and DMX, which stimulates efferent vagal nerve fibres to release acetylcholine, a vagovagal reflex?
    - These act on intracellular cAMP or Ca2+ pathways, resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangement and shuffling of tubulovesicles and fusion of tubulovesicles with apical secretory canaliculi, and the insertion of omeprazole-sensitive H+/K+ ATPase
    - Somatostatin inhibits acid secretion by parietal cells
        - Somatostatin inhibits acid secretion directly by acting on SST2 receptors on parietal cells (decrease cAMP)
        - Somatostatin inhibits histamine secretion by ECL cells
        - Somatostatin also inhibits Gastrin secretion by G cells
        - Somatostatin inhibits ghrelin secretion by X cells
- 3 phases of gastric secretions
    - Cephalic phase - from the sight, smell, thought, taste and swallowing of food
        - Cephalic phase occurs when eating food, before food even enters the stomach
        - Signals from the cerebral cortex are sent to the NTS and the DMX, which then is transmitted via vagus nerve
            - At the body of the stomach, there is activation of vagal postganglionic muscarinic fibres that release acetylcholine, which acts on parietal cells
            - At the antrum of the stomach, vagal postganglionic peptidergic fibres release gastrin-releasing peptide (GPR), stimulating secretion of gastrin (activating gastrin-histamine mechanism)
    - Gastric phase - Set in motion when food is within the stomach, via local neural and hormonal mechanisms, lasting for 3-4 hours (The stomach acts as a food reservoir)
        - Three mechanisms are proposed to increase acid secretion in the gastric phase:
            1. Long vagovagal reflex
                
                Gastric distension stimulates the vagal afferent pathway, stimulating the NTS/DMX, This stimulates the vagal efferent pathway to release acetylcholine
                
            2. Local enteric plexus
                
                Distension of stomach also stimulates local enteric nervous system to release acetylcholine directly
                
            3. Gastrin mechanism
                
                Partially digested proteins stimulate G cells to release gastrin
                
    - Intestinal phase - Initiated when the stomach empties chyme into the duodenum
        - There is a slight increase in acid secretion once the acidic chyme enters the duodenum, which then decreases
        - The increase in acid secretion can be explained by the release of intestinal gastrin
        - 
- VR
    - Greater onentum has anterior and posterior flap, anterior hangs at greater curvature, posterior attach to transverse colon, potential space in between part of lesser sac
    - Hepatoduodenal ligament encloses of hepatic triad, clamped in Pringle manuvuer in liver laceration to cut off blood supply

    - Common hepatic artery branches
        - Right gastric artery
        - Pancreaticduodenal artery
