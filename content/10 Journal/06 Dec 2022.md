- [[Brainstem]]
	- [[Pons]]
		- External features of pons
			- The pons consist of trigeminal nerve, cerebellar peduncle.
			- Anteriorly also characterised by the basilar sulcus/groove (is there association with the basilary artery)
		- The pons is divided longitudinally into the basis tectum, and tegmentum (from ventral to dorsal side)
		- Internal features of the pons
			- Ventrally, characterised by Patchy nerve bundles that subsequently c ompose the corticospinal tract (descending pathway) as well as the pontine nucleus.
			- The pontine nucleus gives rise to pontocerebellar fibres that connect to the middle cerebellar peduncle at the lower pons
			- Ascending pathways
				- Dorsally, the medial lemniscus of the dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway ascends 
			- Cranial nerve nuclei
				- Pontine nucleus
				- At lower pons, the facial nerve laterally, and the abducens nucleus medially
				- At upper pons, the trochear nucleus medially
	- [[Midbrain]]
		- Separated posteriorly into the tectum and the tegmentum
		- In the tectum
			- Consist of the superior colliculus and inferior colliculus
		- In the tegmentum
			- Descending pathways
				- Consist of the cerebral peduncle, which conveys descending pathways such as the corticospinal tract, corticobulbar pathway and corticopontine pathways
			- Also consists of substantial nigra
				- Dopaminergic neruons - Parkinsons
			- Red nucleus medially, receives efferent fibres from cerebellum and sends afferent fibres to cerebrum and the rubrospinal tract
			- Ascendinng pathways - medial leminiscus laterally
			- Note the presence of the cerebral aqueduct and periaqueductal gray
			- Cranial nerve nucleus
				- Trochlear nucleus at lower midbrain, oculomotor nucleus at upper midbrain
- [[Cranial nerves]]
	- Functional components of cranial nerves
		- General somatic sensory (GS)
		- General visceral sensory
		- Special sensory - responsible for vision, smell, tast, hearing and balance (4 out of 5 senses + balance)
		- Somatic motor
		- Branchial motor
		- Vsceral motor
- [[Meninges]]
	- There are 3 layers of meninges
		- Dura mater - a tough barrier for protection
			- Consists of an outer periosteal layer that adheres to the inner surface of the skull, and terminates at the foramen magnum (Hence only present in the head, but not in spine)
			- Inner meningeal layer - lines endosteal layer? and continues below foramen magnum and extends down the spine, terminating at the S2
			- **Dural folds** [[Dural folds are present with the cranial meninges]] - are folds of meningeal layers causing it to separate from the periosteal layer
				- There are 4 dural folds
					- Falx cerebri
					- Tentanium cerebelli
					- Falx cerebelli
					- Diaphragma sellae
				- Dural folds separate the skull into 4 compartments
					- The **falx cerebri** separates the cerebrum into the left and right cerebral hemispheres
					- The two tentorium cerebelli defines the supratentorial (houses cerebrum) and infratentorial compartment (houses brainstem and cerebellum), and separates the occipital lobe from the underlying brainstem and cerebellum (tentorium hiatus - between the two tentorium through which the brainstem passes)
					- Falx cerebelli separates the left and right cerebellar hemisphere
					- Diaphragma sellae civers tge gtoiotseak  fossa and forms a rough over the pituitary gland
				- Dural folds house venous sinus (venous drainage of the brain)
		- Arachnoid mater
			- Specialised connective tissue with trabeculae between dura and pia mater
			- Subarachnoid space surrounds the brain and spinal cord
				- Cerebral spinal fluid circulates within the subarachnoid space: [[Cerebrospinal fluid pathway]]
				- Mechanical support to cranial nerves and cerebral vessels
				- Cushions the brain
		- Pia mater
			- Innermost layer of meninges, tightly covers brain and spinal cord (including cortical gyrus and sulcus)
			- Pia mater invaginates int ventricles with arteries in subarachnoid space, forming Chorid plexus for production of CSF
- Spinal meninges
	- Consists of 3 layers: meningeal dura, arachnoid and subarachnoid space, and the underlying pia mater.
