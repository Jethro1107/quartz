- Let’s hope for a good session today
- Anatomy practical - In the femoral triangle, femoral artery lies anterior to femoral vein, and both are medial to the branches of the femoral nerve
- Non-opioid analgesics
    - Analgesics - Any drugs to ************relieve pain************
    - To understand what non-opioid analgesics are, we must understand what opioid analgesics are:
        - Opioid analgesics: Anything that has the chemical structures of opioids, e.g. methadone
        - Opioids are addictive
        - Opioids target act presynaptically and postsynaptically to suppress action potential generation and propagation to produce analgesic effects…
        - and way more
            - Cf: $ StatPearls: Opioid analgesics
            link: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459161/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459161/)
    - [[Non-opioid analgesics]]  are those that are excluded in the opioid class, and generally are devoided in the adverse effects of opioids.
        - Two classes of Non-Opioid Analgesics
        - Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) Brand name: Panadol, Tylenol
            - Paracetamol produces analgesic effects, but lacks anti-inflammatory effects
            - It is therapeutically safe, possible adverse effects include:
                - Mild rash, hypersensitivity reactions
                - Overdose of paracetamol can result in hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity
            - Underlying biochemical mechanisms of acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity (and nephrotoxicity)
                - In the liver, via the CYP450 enzyme system, it is acetaminophen is metabolised into NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine), which toxic, as it may bind to intracellular hepatic proteins, resulting in hepatocyte dropout which is a defining feature of ************************drug-induced hepatitis (hepatotoxicity).************************
                - In normal conditions, the toxic metabolite is conjugated with glutathione, and eventually excreted in the kidneys. Overdose of paracetamol, eventually, there will be GSH depletion, and hence NAPQI will not be metabolised, resulting in hepatocyte dropout.
                - Underlying mechanism of nephrotoxicity is proposed to be associated with NAPQI.
                - Hence, from this metabolic pathway, increased risk of acetaminophen-related hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity can be due to cytochrome enzyme induction (heavy alcohol consumptioon), or Glutathione depletion
        - NSAIDS #MSS #Pharmacology
            - Anti-inflammatory, Antipyretic, Analgesics
            - Prototype: Aspirin, a Salicylate
            - Design principle of NSAIDS:
                - IN GENERAL, an immune response triggers inflammation. An anti-inflammatory drug should be designed to suppress relatively downstream of the pathway, such that inflammation is suppressed, while immune response is spared. Prostanoid Synthesis is such checkpoint, where everything downstream is inflammatory. (From this, we infer that the MOA of NSAID is inhibition of prostanoid synthesis)
            - Prostanoids lie central to the inflammatory response.
                - Prostanoids - an arachidonic acid derivative, everything that is derived from the cyclooxygenase pathway, i.e. Prostaglandins, Prostacyclin, Thromboxane
                    
                    ![[Untitled 1]]
                    
                - Prostanoids → Dilate precapillary arterioles → Redness
                - Increase permeability of postcapillary venules, induced by histamine and bradykinin → Increased exudation, resulting in swelling
                - Potentiation of pain production by bradykinin
                - Also involved in elevation of thermoregulatory set point in the hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre
            - Hence, antiinflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic.
            - Adverse effect of NSAIDS also relates to its MOA
                - Gastrointestinal disturbance
                    - Dyspepsia, Diarrhoea, nausea and vomitting
                    - Peptic ulcer, as prostaglandin inhibits acid secretion and stimulates gastric mucus secretion.
                    - Hence, contraindicated in those with gastric ulcers.
                - Reduced platelet functions
                    - Due to inhibition of thromboxane A2 production, reduce platelet
                - Skin reaction - Rashes, urticaria, and photosensitivity reactions
                - Renal insufficiency - in susceptible patients, overactivation of RAAS to maintain the renal blood flow (i.e. renal blood flow is already low in those with CHF, Renal artery stenosis). Inhibition of prostaglandin production results in constriction of afferent arterioles, resulting in decreased renal blood flow.
                    - In genral can be reversible at therapeutic dose
                    - But irreversible in chronic NSAID users, “analgesic-associated nephropathy)
                - Liver disorders
                - Bronchospasm, as there is a metabolic shift to the lipoxygenase pathway, resulting in increased production of LT.
            - Pharmacokinetics
                - Metabolised in the liver, glucuronide-conjugated NSAIDS, excreted in the kidneys
                    - It is actively secreted via OAT.
            - Precautions
                - Elderly
                - Pregnancy, risk of postpartum haemorrhage and impaired fetal circulation
                - Current medications
                    - Blood thinners
                    - ACEi
                    - Protein bound drugs, increase free drugs
            - Salicylate
                - Common salicylate includes aspirin and diflunisal
                    - Salicylate, historically is the first class of NSAID, aspirn is the prototype, Diflunisal is an outlier of salicylate.
                    - Aspirin, most commonly used as an antipyretic and antianalgesic, but not an antiinflammatory drug (due to requiring large doses and hence toxic effects), recently used as a cardiovascular drug.
                - Salicylate toxicity (by crossing BBB and suppressing the brain?)
                    - Vascular collapse
                    - Respiratory failure
                    - Fever dehydration acidosis, tinnitus, central hyperventilation ……
                - Precautions with salicylate - Children with viral diseases, due to association with Reye’s Syndromes
                - Pre-existing condition
                    - Comprimised cardiac function will worsen
                    - gout
                - Medication (compete with other drugs for excretion
                    - Uricosuric agent
                    - Penicillin
