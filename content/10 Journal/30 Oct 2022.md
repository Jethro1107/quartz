- [[Lumbosacral plexus]]
    - The lumbosacral plexus can generally be classified as the lumbar plexus and sacral plexus. They are a somatic nerve plexus which most importantly provides sensory and motor innervation to the lower limb (they also innervate the anterolateral abdominal wall, perineum, and provide parasympathetic outflow to inferior hypogastric plexus).
    - The lumbar plexus are formed from the anterior rami of L1-L3, and part of the anterior rami of L4. The remaining part of anterior rami of L4, and anterior rami of L5, unite to form the lumbosacral trunk, which enters the pelvic cavity with the spinal nerves of S1-S3 and part of S4 to form the sacral plexus.
    - The lumbar plexus lies in the substance of psoas major (in association with the ******************posterior abdominal wall******************)
        - Major branches of the lumbar plexus include:
        - L1 - Iliohypogastric n., Ilioinguinal n.
        - L1,L2 - Genitofemoral nerve, which branches into the femoral part and genital part
        - L2, L3 - Lateral femoral cutaneus nerve
        - L2,L3, L4 - Femoral nerve (From posterior division, supplies flexor compartment, note the branches to ***********************psoas major and iliacus***********************
        - L2, L3, L4 - Obturator nerve (anterior division, supplies extensor compartments)
    - [[Femoral nerve]]
        - The femoral nerve is formed by the posterior division of anterior rami of L2-4. It gives branches to psoas and iliacus.
        - It accesses the thigh via below the inguinal ligament. It immediately branches to supplie:
            - Muscles of the anterior compartment of the thigh: rectus femoris and sartorius
            - Pectineus
            - Iliacus
        - It also gives rise to the intermediate and medial cutaneus nerve of the thigh, and also the saphenous nerve (originates from the kne area, supplies medial border of leg, foot, up to ball of big toe
        - The saphenous nerve is a medial branch of the femoral nerve, that passes through the adductor canal, and re-emerges from the knee, it provides sensory innervation to the skin of the medial borders of the leg, foot, up to the ball of the big toe.
    - [[Obturator nerve]]
        - The obturator nerve are formed by the contributions of the anterior division of the ventral rami of L2-4. It descends deep between the psoas major and pelvic brim, and accesses the thigh via the obturator canal.
        - As it emerges from the obturator canal (just superior to the obturator externus), it gives off the anterior branch and the posterior branch
        - The anterior branch branches to provide:
            - Motor innervation to the adductor muscles (except adductor magnus), i.e. pectineus (in 20% of population), adductor longus, adductor brevis, gracilis.
            - Sensory innervation to a small area of medial side of the thigh.
        - The posterior branch pierces through the obturator externus, and descends to provide motor innervation to the obturator externus and the adductor part of adductor magnus
    - The sacral plexus originates from the anterior rami of L4 to S4
        - The [[Sciatic nerve]]  is a big nerve that arises from contributions of L4 to S3 (both the anterior and posterior divisions).
            - It leaves the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen, inferior to the piriformis.
            - In the thigh, it divides into 2 major branches: The common peroneal nerve (contributed by the posterior divisions of L4 to S3, and the tibial nerve, which are formed from the by the anterior divisions of L4 to S3.
        - [[Tibial nerve]]
            - Just above the popliteal fossa, the sciatic nerve branches into the tibial nerve and the common peroneal nerve
            - The tibial nerve consist of nerve fibres arising from the anterior divisions of L4-S3.
            - The tibial nerve leaves the popliteal fossa and enters the posterior compartment of the leg, where it passes through the tendinous arch formed by the tibia and fibula heads of the soleus, and descends along the deep group of posterior compartment of the leg.
            - The tibial nerve produce branches that provide:
                - Motor innervation of the muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg, and plantar muscles
                - A major branch, the sural branch is a cutaneous branch from the tibial nerve at the popliteal fossa, that provides sensory innervation to the posterolateral side of the leg, and the lateral border of foot
            - The tibial nerve accesses the plantar surface of the foot via the tarsal tunnel,  where it wraps around the groove near the medial malleolus and goes onto the plantar surface. It gives rise to the larger medial plantar nerve and lateral plantar nerve.
                - They provide motor innervation of the plantar muscles
                - The medial calcaneal nerve, which is a branch of the tibial nerve at the tarsal tunnel provides sensory innervation to the sole of the heel (calcaneus).
        - [[Common peroneal nerve (Common fibular nerve)]]
            - The common peroneal nerve is formed from the posterior divisions of L4 to S3.
            - Just above the popliteal fossa, the sciatic nerve gives rise to the common peroneal nerve, which descends along the medial borders of the biceps femoris, and wraps around the neck of the fibula.
            - The common peroneal nerve gives rise to the superficial peroneal nerve and the deep peroneal nerve.
            - The superficial peroneal nerve descends along the lateral compartment of the leg, and supplies the muscles in the lateral compartment.
            - The deep fibular nerve passes anteromedially, and descends deep to the extensor digitorum longus. It provides motor innervation to the anterior compartment of the leg.
        - The sacral plexus also gives rise to:
            - Gluteal nerves (superior and inferior)
                - Superior gluteal n. is a branch from the posterior division of anterior rami of L4 to S1, while inferior gluteal n. is a branch from the posterior division of anterior rami of L5 to S2.
                - They leave the pelvic cavity through the greater sciatic foramen, superior to the piriformis.
                - The superior gluteal n. innervates the gluteal medius and gluteal minimis and the tensor fascia lata
                - The inferior gluteal n. innervates the gluteal maximus
            - N. to pirifomis N. to quadratus femoris (L4 to S1), N. to obturator internus (L5 to S2), Posterior cutaneous n. of the thigh, S1 to S3
            - [[Superior gluteal nerve]]
            - [[Inferior gluteal nerve]]
- [[Gateways to the lower limb]]
    - Greater sciatic foramen above the piriformis, Greater sciatic foramen below the piriformis, Lesser sciatic foramen, Gap between inguinal ligament and pelvic bone, Obturator canal
