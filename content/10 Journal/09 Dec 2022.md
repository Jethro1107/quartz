- [[Somatosensation]] (Somatic sensation)
	- Defined as sensation of different parts of the body, except for the special senses
	- Somatosensation is mediated by receptors, ascending pathways, and different parts of the somatosensory cortex
	- Somatic senses can be classified into 3 types: 
		- Mechanicoreceptive senses (those mediated by mechanoreceptors), produced by some mechanical displacement of some tissues
		- Thermoreceptive senses
		- Pain senses
	- Receptors
		- General sensory receptors ([[Somatosensory receptors]]) mediate somatosensation, they respond to general stimuli such as touch, temperature, pain and fibrations
		- Types of receptors and the stimuli they detect
			- Mechanoreceptors - mechanoreceptors are receptors that detect for mechanical displacement of some tissues
				- Mechanoreceptors
				- There are two types of mechanoreceptors: tactile receptors, and proprioreceptors
				- Tactile receptors are responsible for touch, pressure and sensation
				- There are 6 types of tactile receptors
					- Free nerve endings - Found in skin and many other tissue can detect touch and pressure
					- Meissner corpuscle - An elongated encapsulated nerve ending of large type A-beta sensory fibres, activated immediately once they are stimulated (dynamic deformation), and hence is involved in touch and pressure sensation, and movement of object on skin
					- Merkel's cell/disc - Expanded tip receptors that once stimulated, initially, sends a strong signal that weakens, responsible for form and tactile discrimination.
					- Hair follicles (intertwined by A-beta/delta sensory fibre) responsible for detecting movement of objects over surface of body, and the initial contact.
					- Ruffini  corpuscles - Encapsulated corpuscle, found in deeper layers of the skin, stimulated by continuous state of deformation, i.e. prolonged touch and pressure signals.
					- Pacinian corpuscle - deep, stimulated only by rapid compression, detects vibration, or rapid changes in mechanical state of the tissue
			- Thermoreceptors
			- Nociceptors
			- Electromagnetic receptors 
			- Chemoreceptors
			- Only the First three are involved in somatosensation
	- Ascending pathways for somatosensation
		- [[Somatosensory pathways are generally organised in a 3 neuron system]]
			- 3 neuron system:
				- 1st order neuron
					- Found in the PNS, where the cell body sits in the dorsal root ganglion
					- Conducts somatosensory signals from the somatosensory receptors to the spinal cord or brain stem, where they synpase with 2nd order neuron
				- 2nd order neuron
					- Transmit impulse to thalamus or cerebellum
					- Axons decussate to the contralaterally side
				- 3rd order neuron
					- Found in 2 pathways only
					- Found in the thalamus, synapse with neurons of the primary sensory cortex
		- Three pathways are involved in somasensation:
			- [[Dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway]]
				- Receptors
					- Merkel cells, Pacinian corpuscles, muscle spindles, golgi tendon organs etc.
				- Pathway 
					- 1st order neurons (cell bodies within dorsal root ganglia) transmits signals from mechanoreceptors. The central axons pass up the dorsal column, either in the gracilate fasiculus for lower limb, and the cuneate fasiculus for upper limb
					- In the lower medulla, the axons of 1st order neurons synapse with 2nd order neurons in the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus. Axons of 2nd order neurons immediately decussate and ascend on the contralateral side of the medial meniscus of the midbrain
					- It then synapses with 3rd order neurons in the ventral posterolateral nucleus the thalamus, where the axons project to neurons in the somatosensory cortex.
				- Function
					- Tactile sensation including discriminatory touch, proprioception
					- Axons of 1st order neurons are large-diameter, myelinated fibres
			- [[Spinothalamic pathway]]
			- [[Spinocerebellar pathway]]
