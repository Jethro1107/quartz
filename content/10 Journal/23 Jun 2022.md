# CVS examination

### General examination

**Body habitus (Syndromal features gives us an idea of underlying cardiac pathologies):**

Marfan’s Syndrome, Down’s Syndrome, Turner’s Syndrome

**Head and neck**

Eyes - Pallor, Jaundice, Xanthelasma

Tongue - central cyanosis

**Hands**

Clubbing

Peripheral cyanosis

Classical signs of infective endocarditis - Osler’s nodes, Janeway’s lesions, splinter haemorrhage

Xanthomas (on hand joints and elbows) - uderlying hypercholesteremia

**Legs**

Pitting oedema

DVT

Varicose veins

### Examination of arterial pulse

**Radial pulse**

Rate and rhythm

Radial-radial delay

Radial femoral delay

Character and volume - strong?, collapsing pulse, pulsus alternans in advanced HF

**Carotid pulse**

Character and volume

**Brachial pulse**

### Examination of the jugular venous pressure

**Inspection**

First look for the waveform of external jugular vein, then look for the waves of internal jugular vein, which is deep into the sternocleidomastoid muscle

To determine whether a pulse is venous, certain criterias can be applied

- Visible
- Obliterable
- Impalpable
- Changes with respiration (decrease with inspiration and increase with expiration)
- Changes with height and posture
- Hepatojugular reflux

2 things are assessed when examining the jugular venous pressure:

1. Height
    
    At 45 degrees position, measure the height of the JVP from the sternal angle
    
2. Character (waveforms and descent)
    
    Elevated A wave - Tricuspid stenosis
    
    Elevated V wave - Tricuspid regurgitation

### Examination of the precordium

**Inspection**

Ask patient to unbutton clothes

Observe for scars (axillary region and chest) and deformities

Observe for other abnormalities

**Palpation**

Apex beat - location and its characteristics

Normal location - 5th intercostal space, mid clavicular line

Abnormal character of apex beat: 

- Heave (pressure overload) - a displaced forceful, sustained impulse, usually seen in aortic stenosis or hypertension
- Thrusting (volume overload) - a diffuse, non-sustained impulse, common in advanced mitral regurgitation and dilated cardiomyopathy
- Tapping

Parasternal heave:

Parasternal heave is assessed by placing the heel of the hand on the left sternal border

Normally, parasternal impulse is impalpable, but may be detected in severe right ventricular hypertrophy

Thrills - using boney part of the palm, palpate the 4 areas for palpable murmurs

**Auscultation**

Auscultate (diaphragm) for mitral valve, tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve and aortic valve

At mitral valve, turn patient to the left and auscultate mitral valve with bell for mitral stenosis

Auscultate bilateral neck for carotid bruits (bell)
