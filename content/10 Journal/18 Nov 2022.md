    - Today I would like to focus on evergreen note review rather than evergreen note making
        - It has been quite an intensive week of evergreen note making, topics covered since [[14 Nov 2022]]:
            - Treatment of viral hepatitis
            - Nerve compression disorders
            - MSK trauma and the process of healing
            - Molecular mechanism of skeletal development
            - And don’t forget vascular supply of limbs!
        - Well some of these might only be half a lecture, or just fleshing out some old notes (e.g. Vascular supply of limbs), thats roughly adds up to 4 lectures reviewed in 4 days. I haven’t been this inspired to learn ever! And to think I played 4 hours of snooker on Wednesday ([[16 Nov 2022]])…
    - It’s friday and i want to review tons of notes, and take rough notes on things like EBDM and Public health
    - In sorted3 already

    - Something extra:
        - [x]  GIS EBDM
        - [ ]  OI review 1
        - [x]  GI secretory functions
- [[Scapular anastamosis]]
    - As the circumflex scapular artery accesses the posterior scapular region via the triangular space, it anastamoses with branches of 1st part of subclavian artery, namely the suprascaular artery and dorsal scapular artery
        - Suprascapular artery passes over the superior transverse scapular ligament (not through the suprascaular foramen), and gives branches on the supraspinous fossa and infraspinous fossa
        - Dorsal scapular artery passes along the medial border of the scapulae (along with dorsal scapular nerve…
    - This creates a collateral blood supply from the 1st part of subclavian to 3rd part of axillary artery, maintaining blood supply to the upper limb when the axillary artery is blocked
- [[Hip joint anastamosis]]
    - The circumflex femoral arteries and the 1st perforating branch of the deep femoral artery anastamoses with the superior gluteal artery and inferior gluteal artery, which are branches of internal iliac artery.
    - This provides collateral blood supply that maintains blood supply to the lower limb when the external iliac artery is blocked
- GIS EBDM
    - Covers the concept of [[Prevention]]
        - Defining prevention
            - Actions that prevent disease occurence, slow disease progression or minimize the impact of disease
            - This definition also implies levels of prevention
        - Levels of prvention:
            - Primary prevention - prevent diseases from occuring (reducing disease incidence)
                - Target risk factors or causes of diseases in population or individuals
                - E.g. immunization
            - Secondary prevention - aims to improve survival by delaying onset and duration of clinical disease (minimize the impact of disease)
                - Targets individuals with early disease
                - Screening is the prototypical example of secondary prevention
            - Tertiary prevention - aims to improve survival by slowing disease progression and reducing disease sequelae
                - Targets individuals with established diseases
                - E.g. stroke rehabilitation
            - Primordial prevention
                - Targets underlying upstream social, economic, and environmental determinants of health
                - E.g. public policies and intersectoral action, control of air pollution
            - Quaternary prevention - prevents iatrogenesis
                - Targets individuals and groups at risk of over diagnosis or over treatment
                - E.g. Evidence-based medicine
        - Prevention approaches
            - Individual - intervention appropriate to high risk individuals
            - Population approach - intervention applied to the entire population, enable to shift the curve of exposure/relative risk in a favorable direction
            - Population approach is ideal, but limited to prevention paradox, which is individuals perceive little benefit from interventions, but may benefit population
        - PICO questions about prevention falls under two types:
            - What are the risk factors (i.e. predictors) of a disease?
                - Study types: retrospective cohort studies
            - How effective are interventions in reducing incidence of disease (primary prevention)?
                - Study types: RCT
    - [[Screening]]
        - Screening is the “presumptive identification” of an unrecognized disease or defect by the application of tests, examinations or other procedures which can be applied rapidly
            - Who probably has disease from who probably do not, emphasis of the word probably… The ideal screening test should high sensitivity, at the expense of lower specificity… those false positive will eventually be properly classified as not having diseases in ****************diagnostic tests****************
        - The aim: secondary prevention (improve survival by minimizing the duration of disease), particularly early diagnosis, reducing morbidity and/or mortality
            - Assumption: Earlier diagnosis leads to earlier and more effective treatment, which decreases the adverse effects of a disease and improves survival
        - Criteria of screening
            - [[Wilson and Junger’s 10 criteria for screening]]
                - Knowledge of disease
                    - important health problem
                    - Recognizable latent or early symptomatic stage
                    - The natural history of the condition, including development from latent to declared disease should be adequately understood
                - Knowledge of screening test
                    - Suitable test or examination
                    - Test acceptable to the population
                    - Case finding should be continuous (not a “once and for all” project) - i.e. resource should be sufficient for continuous screening
                - Treatment of disease
                    - Accepted treatment for patients with declared disease
                    - Facilities for diagnosis and treatment should be available
                    - Agreed policy on whom to treat as patients (many diagnosed, who do we treat? Im not understanding this)
                - Cost-effectiveness
                    - Cost of case fiinding should be economically balanced in relation to possible expenditure on medical care as a whole
        - But does screening work? Does it actually reduce mortality?
        - Evaluating screening tests and programs
            - Screening → applies tests → all tests are analyzed in the same way: appraised for their reliability and validity
                - Reliability - ability of the test to give the sam results when repeated
                    - Depends on stability of physiological state measured, technical characteristics of test, and aggreement (interobserver agreement and intraobserver agreement)
                - Validity - ability of the test to correctly identify individuals with or without preclinical disease
                    - Sensitivity and specificity
        - [[Biases in prevention studies]]  [https://compendiumapp.com/post_lj2HQr-Bl#:~:text=Lead-time bias%3A Overestimation of,detected that are slowly progressing](https://compendiumapp.com/post_lj2HQr-Bl#:~:text=Lead%2Dtime%20bias%3A%20Overestimation%20of,detected%20that%20are%20slowly%20progressing%20) .
            - Lead-time bias
                - A bias in prevention studies that reveals an apparently improved survival time with no change in time from disease onset to death, (pathological onset to death does not change)
                - Screening enables earlier diagnosis, which makes it look like the individual lived longer
                - Avoid by using mortality as the outcome measure instead
            - Length time bias
                - Length time bias is bias that is caused by relative eccess amounts of less agressive (slower progressive) diseases that can be picked up by screening
                - Avoid by comparing outcomes in RCT
            - Volunteer bias
                - Confounder: A persons health awareness or SES affects both decision to screen, and related to morbidity and mortality
                - Avoid by comparing outcomes in RCT

- [[Molecular basis of bone development]]
    - [[Limb development]]
        - Limbs are developed from the lateral plate mesoderm, forming buds, that extend proximodistally, forming the skeletal elements
        - During limb development, the limb is patterned in its AP axis, Proximal distal axis, and dorsal-ventral axis, which is highly regulated via different signalling pathways (a molecular control of limb outgrowth and patterning)
            - For proximodistal, it is regulated via FGF signalling
                - Stylopod (humerus), zeugopod (radius and ulna) , autopod (wrist and digit)
            - anteriorposterior patterning is regulated by sonic hedgehog signalling
            - DOrsal-ventral patterning is regulated by WNT signalling
        - 4 phases of skeletal morphogenesis
            - Migration - Mesenchymal cells migrate to epithelial cells
            - Cell interaction - Mesenchymal cells interact with the Basement membrane
            - Condensation - Mesenchymal cells condense into a ball of cells
            - Differentiation - Differentiate into osteochondroprogenitor cells and subsequently into obsteoblasts and chondrocytes
            - Differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoprogenitor cells requires early expression of SOX9 gene
                - The differentiation into osteoblasts and chondrocytes and osteoblasts is regulated by 2 genes
                    - [[Osteoblast differentiation requires activation of RUNX2]]
                        - Osteoblast differentiation required activation of RUNX2 gene (a transcription factor, a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation, as it regulates osteoblast specific genes (genes required to synthesize bone matrix), there is also participation of the the Osx gene
                            - [[Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is caused by haploinsufficiency caused by a Loss of Function mutation in [[RUNX2]] is caused by haploin]]
                                - This results in aplastic clavicles, delayed closure of cranial sutures and fontanelles, and scoliosis
                    - [[Chondrocyte differentiation requires activation of SOX9]]
                        - Chondrocyte differentiation requires activation of SOX9 (SRY-related HMG (high mobility group) box (DNA binding region) genes, where SOX9 regulates the expression of chondrocyte specific genes (genes required for synthesis of cartilage matrix, such as collagen II, IX and XI and aggrecan, in conjunction with Sox5,6
        - Limb development involves the budding of lateral plate mesoderm forming skeletal elements - Limb development occurs in a proximal-distal sequence::::
            - Cartilage is synthesized as continuous rods, and via joint initiation, form cavitations, bifurcations and segmentations, development of joint
        - [[Anteroposterior patterning (patterning of digits) is regulated by sonic hedgehog [[signalling]] ]]
            - hh sending cells are found in the zone of of polarizing region, releasing shh that functions by producing a morphogen concentration gradient, with preset values that determine different cell fates
                - Hh the morphogen, Gli complex, the downstream transcription factor
                    - Hh sending cells express a precursor, that conjugates with the cholesterol molecule at the end terminal
                        - When it is released, it is cleaved by autocatalytic activity
                    - In the absense of Hh, Ptc inhibits Smo, which results in degradation of Gli complex, resulting in repression of Hh signalling cascade
                    - Hh binds to Patched (PTc) receptor, which removes its inhibitory effect on Smothened (Smo), the transducer. Smothened when activated maintains high levels of Gli complex, which serves as an activator of Hh signalling cascade
                - Shh morphogen serves as a gradient, which cause different cell fates at different concentrations of hh. This regulates anterior posterior limb patterning, forming digits.
                    - Defects in Shh signalling pathway results in Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome increased number of digits and the digits are fused
        - [[Chondrocyte proliferation in the epiphyseal plate is regulated by FGF signalling, particularly FGF-FGFR3 signalling]]
            - FGF signals requires FGF as a morphogen, and FGFR as the receptor (tyrosine kinase receptor), and normally the outcome of this signalling pathway is mitosis, proliferation…
            - Except for FGFR 3, which inhibits proliferation, it acts as a negative regulator of chondrocyte proliferation (negative, as in contrast of the usual role of FGFR being mitogenic)
            - FGF signalling in proliferative chondrocytes
                - When FGF binds to FGFR3, with heparan sulphate proteoglycan as a co-factor, it results in dimerization and cross phosphorylation FGFR3.
                - Which phosphorylate STAT-1 into phospho STAT1
                - Phospho-STAT1 activates p21
                - ps21 is a Cdk inhibitor, inhibiting cdk 2 and 4 complexes, which inhibits cell cycle progression from G1 to S, inhibiting chondrocyte proliferation
            - [[Gain of function mutations in FGFR3 underlie Achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and Thanatophoric dysplasia]]
                - May cause stabilization of dimer
                - May cause formation of sulphide bond, or mutations in kinase domain that causes it to remain active without dimerization, both of which are ligand independent activations of FGFR
                - Muations results in activation of TK domain, increasing phosphorylation of STAT1, increasing expression of p21. This results in inhibition of Cdk-2,3 complexes, that supress cell cycle progression from G1 to S. Thus inhibiting chondrocyte proliferation, which retards bone growth via endochondral ossification.
        - [[Chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy in epiphyseal plate is regulated by the IHH PTHrP negative feedback loop]]
            - IHH/PTHrP negative feedback loop regulates the ratio between proliferating chondrocytes and hypertrophic chondrocytes, which ultimately regulate bone growth by endochondral ossification.
            - Ihh expression restricted in the prehypertrophic chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate has 2 effects:
                - Short range: Stimulates chondrocyte proliferation
                - Long range: Stimulates the expression of PTHrP in the articular cartilage.
            - PTHrP diffuses back to the epiphyseal plate and binds to the the PTH-1R and inhibits chondrocyte hypertrophy.
            - This increases the ratio between proliferating chondrocytes and hypertrophic chondrocytes.
            - When not hypertrophied, this reduces the Ihh production
