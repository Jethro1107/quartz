    - Iliohypogastric (superiorly) nerve and ilioinguinal nerve (inferiorly)
        - The iliohypogastric nerve has a lateral cutaneous branch that supplies the upper lateral aspects of the buttocks, while the anterior cutaneous branch supplies the anteroabdominal wall
        - Ilioinguinal nerve accompanies the spermatid cord into the superficial inguinal ring, into the inguinal canal
    - Genitofemoral nerve
        - Has 2 branches, femoral branch (L1) and genital branch (L2)
        - The genital branch of the genital femoral nerve supplies accompanies the round ligament or spermatic cord
        - The femoral branche provides sensory innervation to the femoral triangle
    - Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve
        - The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve originates from the posterior division of the anterior rami of L2 and L3.
        - It exclusively carries sensory fibres, as it branches into the anterior branch and posterior branch, which provide sensory innervation to the anterolateral surface of the leg and the lateral surface of the leg respectively.

    Is there a way to associate the nerve root levels with specific nerves known to innervate these areas, e.g. Iliohypogastric nerve, Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve

- 20:00 - Gout
    - **What is gout?**
        - Gout is an Inflammatory joint disorder that is characterised by abnormal uric acid deposition in the joint.
    - **Pathogenesis of gout**
        - Gout is precipitated in hyperuricemia.
        - It is largely associated with abnormal Uric acid metabolism, either by abnormal intake of purines, or genetic predisposition that results in reduced uric acid excretion.
            - Uric acid metabolism summarised:
                - **********Synthesis.********** There are 2 sources of uric acid in our body:
                    - The exogenous supply from dietary nucleotides
                    - The endogenous supply through normal cell turnover and the release of cellular nucleotides
                    - Particularly, purines are obtained, which via purine catabolism, forms uric acid
                - ****Excretion****. Purines undergo renal excretion, freely filtered, almost completely resorbed by the PCT, and small amount is secreted by DCT.
                - Biliary excretion, eventually degraded by gut microbes
            - Hyperuricemia is caused by the either increased synthesis or decreased excretion (more common).
                - Most cases of primary gout is a result of reduced excretion, with no known cause.
                - Secondary gout can be caused by a defect in the salvage pathway.
                    - But also due to increased cellular turnover, tumour lysis syndrome, or decreased excretion in CKD
            - Elevated uric acid pool results in precipitation of urate crystals in the joints, stimualating production of cytokines that recruit leukocytes, via inflammasome pathway, activation of alternate pathway of complement activation, and the neutrophil lysis.
                - Triggering inflammation. They release free radicals, protease and aa metabolites, tissue injury + inflam.
        - Inflammation caused by gout is mediated by Inflamasomes.
        - Often, gout triggers a granulomatous response.
    - **Pathology of gout**
        - There is usually chalky-white deposits (uric acid crystals) in the joint space, sometimes, even erroding the underlying bone.
    - **Histopathology of gout**
        - On histology, spicular crystals, eosinophilic material is present.
        - Crystals are often surrounded by the by macrophages, and giant cells.
    - **Clinical features of gout**
        - Gout typically presents as acute joint pain, and is usually considered as a Monoarticular joint pathologies.
        - A particular important extraarticular feature is the formation of gouty tophi, which are depositions of uric acid crystals subcutaneously, in the elbows, toes and ears. These regions are relatively cool which aids precipitation. Gouty tophis are not painful.
