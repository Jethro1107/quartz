- Cervical myelopathy
    - Causes
        - IV disc herniation into spinal canal, centrally
        - Osteophytes
        - Ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), also a common cause
        - Deformed uncovertebral process
        - Apophyseal, Zygapophyseal facet joint hypertrophy (Same thing)
        - Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy
    - Clinical features (may need to read pbl notes or robbins or kumar and clarke)
        - Weakness in both upper and lower limb
        - Neck pain
        - Non dermatomal
        - Non compatable spinal level
- [[Cervical myelopathy]] (cont.)
    - Cervical myelopathy is a pathological process that involves degenerative changes to the cervical vertebrae and intervertebral disc that results in narrowing of the cervical spinal canal, i.e. cervical spinal stenosis, that results in compression of the cervical spinal cord.
    - Pathoanatomy of cervical myelopathy
        - Specifically called cervical spondylosis, degeneration of the cervical spine with age
        - Can be caused by cervical spondylosis - Degenerative changes to the cervical vertebrae, that results in osteophyte formation of the vertebral bodies, facet joints, uncovertebral joints, compressing on the cervical spinal cord, ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament also
        - Can be caused by IV disc herniation - particularly in central area
    - Clinical features of cervical myelopathy
        - Neck pain
        - Complain of pain in both the upper and lower limbs
        - Sensory symptoms: Parasthesia (burning and tingling sensation) in the upper and lower limb, numbness
            - Sensory deficits, usually related to dorsal column function (reduced joint position and vibratory sense) and loss of pain sensation, can be elicited in the lower extremities and may contribute to the gait impairment.
        - Motor symptoms: Muscle weakness, usually complaining of loss of fine motor control (clumsiness), abnormal gait, if severely compressed, will lose sphincter control (a late and severe symptom that requires immediate surgical decompression)
            
            Weakness in the lower extremities with upper motor neuron characteristics: increased reflexes, increased tone, and present Babinski signs.
            
            ●Lower motor neuron findings (weakness, atrophy, and suppressed reflexes) in a myotomal distribution in the arms or hands. The C5-7 myotomes are most often affected
            
    - Physical examination findings of cervical myelopathy
        - Hyperreflexia, or exagerated deep tendon reflex
- [[Physiological anatomy of the spinal cord]]
    - H-shaped grey region, consisting of the cell bodies
    - Surrounding white matter consist of the axons
        - Separated into the descending tract (motor functions)
            - lateral corticospinal tract
                - Consisting of axons of upper otor neurons (in primary motor cortex of precentral gyrus) for communication between the brain to the lower motor neurons within the spinal cord.
                - When the cell bodies of the upper motor neurons (i.e. in the primary motor cortex) is stimulated, signal is transmited down axons of the lateral corticospinal tract, which synapse with lower motor neurons in the anterior (ventral horn), which then via its axons stimulate the fibre
                - Mainly voluntary, upper extremity motor pathways are more medial (medial to lateral: C T L S)
                - Also, it is contralateral, i,e the right lateral cortical spinal tract supplies the left extremities (add details)
            - Anterior corticospinal tract
        - Ascending tract (sensory functions)
            - Dorsal columns (posterior funiculi)
                - For deep touch, proprioception and vibratory sensations
            - Lateral spinothalamic tract - for pain pathways and temperature
            - Ventral spinothalamic tract - for light tract
- Spinal cord injury injury to the spinal cord that results in compression of spinal cord (usually traumatic?)
- [[Central cord syndrome]]
    - Central cord syndrome is the most common incomplete cord injury that is almost always caused by traumatic injury
    - Etiologies
        - Trauma (especially with cervical arthritis) - most commonly caused by hyperextension injury of the neck, that results in cervical spinal stenosis
            - Older patients tend to have worse prognosis due to underlying cervical spondylosis
        - Others are less likely
            - Cervical spondylotic myelopathy
            - Syringomyelia
            - Neoplasm (metastatic, glial neoplasia or lymphoma)
    - Pathophysiology
        - The central cord is compressed more severely, which has several implications
            - Pain and temperature sensations is more affected than posterior column sensation
            - Muscle weakness in the arm is greater than the leg, as the umn fibres for cervical spinal levels are more medial than the lumbosacral
            - SPhincter dysfunction also common
- [[Arterial supply of the spinal cord]]
    - 1 anterior spinal artery, 2 posterior spinal arteries, Radicular arteries
    - Anterior spinal artery
        - Union of 2 spinal arteries from the vertebral artery at the foramen magnum (hole in occipital bone that enables passage of spinal cord into the skull)
        - Midline vessel that lies on anterior median fissure of the cord, descends along the length of the cord, becomes small or absent in the thoracic region
        - Anterior to cord
- [[Anterior cord syndrome]]
    - Caused by anterior spinal artery territory ischemia
    - Fracture fragments, retropulsed disc
    - Loss of motor functions, pin and temperature sensation, relative preservation of position sense (as dorsal column is spared)
    - Poor prognosis: 10-20% can have muscle recovery, but with poor power and coordination
- [[Healing]]  is the body’s replacement of damaged tissue by living tissue, either by regeneration or repair (Walter and Israel 1987)
    - [[4 phases of healing]] , i.e. Sequential (but often overlapping phases after the initial insult)
        - Hemostasis (Bleeding phase) - hours
        - Inflammation - days, maximum of 3 days
        - Proliferative phase (Granulation) - weeks, 2-3 weeks
        - Remodelling - months
    - Highly regulated by growth factors

    - Mode of healing depends on wound distance
    - Healing of different tissue roughly follows these 4 phases, but with certain degree of variation
        - Bone repair (Secondary healing) - True healing
        
        - [[Bone repair]]
            - Bone repair occurs after injury to a bone, i.e. fracture, and initiated with inflammation
            - Inflammation stage is followed by formation of granulation tissue, and migration of fibroblast and messenchymal tissues
            - The messenchymal tissues form a fibrous and cartilaginous callus, and via endochondral ossification, forms primary bone.
            - Subsequent remodelling of primary bone into secondary bone to original bone shape.
        - Bleeding → Inflammation → Soft callus proliferation → Hard callus proliferation and remodelling
            - Soft callus - Periosteum and endoosteum proliferates to form a fibrocartilage structure, that is normally wider than the fracture site, which improves stability
            - Hard callus
                - Blood vessels penetrating the soft callus deliver osteoblasts, bone forming through endochondral ossification
                - Laying down osteoid and calcify it → Hard callus (primary bone)
            - Subsequent remodelling, replaces primary bone with secondary bone and back to original bone shape
    - Healing of Nerve injuries differ from other tissues
        - [[Seddon and Sunderland classification of nerve injury]]
            - Neurapraxia
            - Axonotmesis
            - Neurotmesis
        - [[Wallerian degeneration preceeds healing in nerve injury with axon discontinuity]]
            - Initiations with Wallerian degeneration of the nerve distal to the injury (Muscles no longer innervated, will atrophy)
            - Macrophages clear up the debris
            - Regeneration
                - Schwann cells proliferate and regenerate myelin tunnel
                - Axon sprouts through the myelin tunnel, and re-innervates the muscle
                - Poor apposition will result in a bundle of nerve fibres that results in a painful traumatic neuroma
