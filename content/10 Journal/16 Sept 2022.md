- Pathology Of pancreas
    - Delta cells of islet population are D cells
- Pancreatic secretions
    - Secretions implies an exocrine function (the ones that aids digestion of food)
    - Pancreas also has an endocrine function (highly involved in glucose metabolism)
    - Histologically, the exocrine pancreas consist of pancreatic acini and the ductal system
    - Secretions from exocrine pancreas
        - Acinar cells secret isotonic, H+ rich fluid containing pancreatic enzymes - Regulated by Ca2+ intracellular pathway
            - These include inactive zymogens (trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, proelastase and procarboxypeptidase) and active enzymes (pancreatic alpha-amylase, pancreatic lipase, carboxyl ester lipase, and DNAase, RNAase
            - These are enclosed in pre-produced secretory granules, where the inside of the granules is highly acidified due to vesicular H+ ATPase. H+ in secretory granules functions as a negative feedback signal to inhibit secretion of pancreatic enzymes (Due to the activation of Ca2+ ATPase).
            - An ionic mechanism underlies the release of an isotonic plasma-like fluid that facilitates the solubilization of the contents from secretory granules.
                - Basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase pumps out 3 Na+ into interstitium and pumps in 2K+. K+ returns to the interstitium via basolateral K+ channels.
                - pNBC1 (Na+/HCO3- cotransporter) on basolateral membrane cotransports Na+ with HCO3- into acinar cells.
                - As HCO3- concentration builds up, AE2 on basolateral membrane pumps out HCO3- in exchange for intestitial Cl-.
                - Upon stimulation, increase of Ca2+ levels results in activation of apical Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (TMEM16A)
                - Cl- built up enters the lumen via the channel, this creates a negative potential and an osmotic gradient that drives movement of Na+ and water into lumen via tight junctions.
        - Ductal cells (centroacinar cells and intercalated ducts) responsible for producing HCO3- rich fluids (accounting for much of the bulk of the fluid)
            - Basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase pumps out 3 Na+ and pumps in 2 K+ at the expense of 1ATP.
            - This drives basolateral pNBC to cotransport Na+ with HCO3- from blood into cell.
            - HCO3- built up drives SLC26A6 to pump out HCO3- in exchange for Cl-. Apical CFTR facilitates the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger by recycling Cl-.
            - The increase in HCO3- secretions creates an osmotic gradient that cause osmosis of water into the lumen, creating an isotonic bicarbonate secretion.
            - Mutation in CFTR gene results in inefficient HCO3- being secreted, and less water secreted by ductal cells. This reduces pancreatic flow rate, that results in precipitaiton of proteins → atrophy and damage
            - Another mechanism:
                - CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 via CA → H+ + HCO3-
                - HCO3 - is pumped into the lumen by apical Cl-/HCO3- antiport
                - H+ is pumped out into interstitum via NHE, creating an acid tide
            - Amount of fluid release by ductal cells determine pancreatic flow rate, which determines ionic composition of the pancreatic juice
                - Basal secretions (secretions mainly made by acinar cells, little secretion by ductal cells), as acinar cells mainly produce isotonic solution with Na+, Cl-, H2O and ductal cells produce isotonic solution with Na+, HCO3- and H2O. Relative abundance of the two secretions determine concentration of Cl- vs concentration of HCO3-.
                - The altering concentration of HCO3- and Cl- can also be explained by the apical Cl-/HCO3- exchanger on ductal cells.

    - Regulation of pancreatic secretions
        - The basic factors that stimulate pancreatic secretions are acetylcholine, cholecystokinin and secretion
            - Acetylcholine and cholecystokinin stimulate acinar cells more than ductal cells, resulting in secretion of large amounts of enzymes and small amounts of fluids
            - Secretin stimulates the secretion of large quantities of isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution by ductal cells, but have little effects on enzyme secretion by acinar cells.
        - Cephalic phase
            - Regulation of pancreatic secretions in cephalic phase follows the same mechanism as that during gastric secretion. Sight, thought, smell, taste of food results in stimulation of cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex stimulates the appetite centres, which then stimulate the NTS/DMX. This stimulates the efferent vagal pathway, resulting in release of acetylcholine.
            - Note that acetylcholine only stimulates acinar cells (arccounting for 20% of total pancreatic enzyme secretions)… Little stimulation of ductal cells results in lack of fluid secretion. Hence, little enzymes actually reach the duodenal lumen.
        - Gastric phase
            - Same vagocagal reflex stimulates vagal efferents to release acetylcholine.
        - Intestinal phase
            - Intestinal phase involves production of copius amounts of bicarbonate and fluids, as well as enzymes, mediated by secretin and cholecystokinin.
            - Secretin is secreted when acidic chyme is is delivered into the duodenum. Released by S cells in the mucosa of the upper small intestine … secreted as prosecretin and activated when pH reaches 4-5 and absorbed into circulation.
            - Secretin eventually reach the pancreas, activates cAMP pathway, which results in activation of CFTR… recycling of Cl- on apical membrane facilitates bicarbonate secretion
            - Functions: Neutralization of acidic chyme and provides an alkaline medium for pancreatic enzymes to act on
            - Cholecystokinin is released by I cells in mucosa of duodenum and upper jejunum, release is stimulated by long chain fatty acids and partially digested proteins/amino acids
            - Cholecystokinin activates Ca2+ signalling pathway (similar to gastrin?), which results in activation of TMEM16A (increase Cl- secretion, probably physiologically less important?) and exocytosis of enzymes
