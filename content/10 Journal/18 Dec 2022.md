- [[Viscerocranium]]
	- The viscerocranium (fascial skeleton) consist of 15 bones
		- Paired bones:
			- Lacrimal bone
			- [[Zygomatic bone]]
				- The cheekbone
				- The zygomatic bone has the body, the temporal process, frontal process, and maxillary process
				- Note that the zygomatic arch is formed by the union of the zygomatic process of temporal bone, and the temporal process of the zygomatic bone
			- Nasal bone
			- [[Maxilla]]
				- The maxilla is a paired bone that forms part of the Viscerocranium
				- Parts:
					- Frontal processes, projects to frontal bone, forming the medial (and part of inferior) border of the orbit
					- Zygomatic process, projects to the zygomatic bone
					- Alveolar process projects inferiorly and bears the upper row of teeth
					- Palatine process
						- Palatine process projects medially and articulates with contralateral maxillae
						- Forms the hard palate
				- Features
					- Infraorbital foramen - On the maxilla, for the exit of the maxillary division of trigeminal nerve, emerging as infraorbital nerve
			- Inferior nasal chonca
			- Palatine bone
		- Unpaired bone
			- Vomer
- [[Temporal bone]]
- [[Frontal bone]]
	- The frontal bone is forms part of the calvaria of the neurocranium.
	- It forms the bone of the forehead.
	- The inferior border of the frontal bone forms the superior borders of the orbit
	- Medial tot he superior border of the orbit, is marked by the supraorbital arch
		- passage of supraorbital VAN and supratrochlear VAN.
- [[Occipital bone]] #FC 
	- Unpaired bone that forms part of the neurocranium.
	- Features found inferiorly
		- The foramen magnum - largest opening to the skull
		- Occipital condyles - articulate with atlas lateral masses of the atlas )
- [[The cranial base is is separated into three cranial fossas]]
	- The cranial base is separated into three cranial fossas
		- The anterior cranial fossa
			- made of frontal bone, ethmoid bone, and parts of sphenoid bone
			- Houses the frontal lobe
			- Cribiform plate enables the passage of axons of bipolar cells into the olfactory bulb
			- Sits above orbit and nasal cavity
			- Houses part of frontal lobe
		- The middle cranial fossa
			- Formed by parts of sphenoid bone and temporal bone
			- Houses temporal lobe
			- Above zygomatic arch
		- Posterior cranial fossa
			- Formed primarily by the occipital bone and temporal bone
			- Houses cerebellum below superior nuchal line
			- Houses occipital lobe
