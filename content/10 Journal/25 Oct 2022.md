- [[Anatomy of the liver]]
    - The liver is the largest gland of the body
        - 4 quadrants and 9 regions, The liver is well protected by the thoracic cage, and is usually not palapable even with inspiration (A palpable liver could be indicative of hepatomegaly?)
        - It consist of the diaphragmatic surface, which involves the superior, anterior surface of the diaphragm, and is in contact with the inferior surfaces of the diaphragm.
        - The visceral surface, which is in contact with many viscera (we can consider this as the inferoposterior surface of the liver.
        - On the visceral surface, an H-shape is seen, the horizontal line, marked by the porta hepaticus (which conveys the hepatic artery, portal vein and the hepatic ducts), on the left, marked by the ligamentum venosum (remnant of ductus venosum of fetal circulation) and the ligamentum teres hepatis (round ligament), and on the right, marked by the IVC and the gallbladder.
            
            This H shaped structure defines the left and right lobe inferoposteriorly, and gives rise to the caudate and quadrate lobe Functionally considered to be part of the left lobe of the liver.
            
            The quadrate lobe is visible on the visceral surface of the liver, and is bounded on the left by the ligamentum teres and on the right by the gallbladder
            
            The caudate lobe is visible on the visceral surface of the liver and is bounded on the left by the ligamentum venosum, and on the right, the inferior vena cava. Functionally distinct from the left and right lobe.
            
        - Ligaments of the liver
            - Suspended to the anterior abdominal wall by the falciform ligament, which accompanies the round ligament, lesser omentum (to stomach and duodenum)
            - To the diaphragm by the coronary ligaments and left and right triangular ligaments.
            - The bare area is the diaphragmatic surface where it is not suspended to the diaphragm and not covered by visceral peritoneum.
        - Left and right lobe
            - Superoanteriorly, separated by the falciform ligament, Inferoposteriorly, separated by the ligamentum venosum and ligamentum teres
- [[Anatomy of the pancreas]]
    - The pancreas is a secondarily retroperitoneal organ that is posterior to the stomach. It has 4 parts:
        - Head - Which is located in the C-shaped concavity that is the duodenum,
        - Neck - Which is anterior to the superior mesenteric a and v, It is also the site where the superior mesenteric and splenic veins joins to form the portal vein
        - Body - Posterior to the stomach, extends between the neck and the tail
        - Tail - Passes between the splenorenal ligament
    - Within the pancreas, the pancreatic duct drains pancreatic secretions from the tail to the head. In the head, it passes inferiorly and joins the common bile duct, forming the Ampulla of Vater. The ampulla drains the mixed secretions into the second part of the duodenum, at the major duodenal papila. Surrounding the ampulla is a sphincter, collection of smooth muscles.
    - Blood supply of the pancreas
        - Receives arterial blood from:
            - Anterior superior pancreaticduodenal artery, posterior superior pancreatic duodenal artery, gastroduodenal artery, branch of common hepatic artery.
            - Dorsal pancreatic artery and great pancreatic artery, branches of the splenic artery. The anastamotic connection between the two forms the inferior pancreatic artery
            - Inferior pancreatoduodenal artery (Branch of SMA), which branches into atnerio and posterior inferior pancreatoduodenal artery
