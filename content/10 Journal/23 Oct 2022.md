- Muscles of the lower limb
    - There are no muscles to move the pelvic girdle, as it is tightly stabilised at the sacroiliac joint by intrinsic and extrinsic ligaments. There is no reason to have muscles to move the pelvic girdle with respect to the sacrum.
    - Muscles that move the hip joint forms the muscles of the gluteal region and the anterior hip
        - Can be separated into superficial group (Gluts, tensor fascia lata) and deep group (Lateral rotators and hip flexors)
        - Superficial parts:
            - Gluteal maximis and tensor fascia lata forms the superficial layer of muscles that forms the gluteal region and the anterior hip.
            - Gluteal maximus originates from the ilium, sacrum and the sacrotuberous ligament, and insert at the iliotibial tract and the gluteal tuberosity on the femur
            - Movement: Extension (provides the force when standing up, or walking up a slope), and lateral rotation of the femur at the hip joint.
            - Tensor fascia lata
                - Originates from the iliac crest, between the ASIS and iliac tubercle, inserts at the iliotibial tract
                - Flexion and medial rotation
            - What is the iliotibial tract - A thickened part of the facia lata (deep fascia of the thigh) laterally, that originates from the iliac crest, at the level of the iliac tubercle, and distally attaches at the leteral condyle of the femur
        - Deep to the gluteal maximus
            - Gluteal medius (lateral to maximus and gluteal minimis (deep to gluteal medius)
            - Both originate on the outer surface of the ileum (the surface that faces the gluteal regions), and they insert onto the greater trochanter, medius inserts on lateral surface, minimis inserts at the anterior surface
            - They both help abduct the hip joint, help maintain pelvis in a horizontal position during walking.
        - Deep to gluteal maximus, a group of muscles called lateral rotators that all insert on the posterior surface of the greater trochanter → aims to laterally rotate the hip joint
            - Piriformis - anterior surface of sacrum, passes through the greater sciatic foramen and inserts onto the posterior surface of greater trochanter of femur
            - Superior gemellus - originates from the ischial spine and inserts onto the greater trochanter
            - Inferior gemellus - originates from the ischial tuberosity and inserts at the posterior surface of greater trochanter
            - Obturator internus - Originates from the inner surface of the obturator membrane, leaves the pelvic cavity via the lesser sciatic foramen, turns 90 degrees, and inserts onto the greater trochanter between the two gemellus
            - Quadratus femoris - originates from ischial tuberosity and inserts at the quadrate tubercle (on the intertrochanteric crest)
            - Obturator externus - originates on the outer surface of the obturator membrane, the courses posteriorly, then turns at a sharp angle near the lesser sciatic notch to insert onto the posterior surface of the greater tubercle.
        - Hip flexors - Iliopsoas
            - Psoas major originates from the the transverse process of T12 to L5, and courses inferiorly and anteriorly, along the pelvic brim. It courses under the inguinal ligament, in the femoral canal, and inserts at the lessor trochanter
            - Iliacus originates from the iliac fossa, crosses the femoral cana and inserts into the lesser trochanter
    - Muscles of the thigh - These muscles act on the knee joint and the hip joint
    - The thigh region is demarcated between the hip joint and the knee joint. Anteriorly it is below the inguinal ligament. Posteriorly, it is below the gluteal folds superficially, and below the inferior margins of the gluteal maximus.
        - Separated into the anterior group and posterior group by the lateral and medial intermuscular fascia
        - The anterior group are mainly extensors of the knee joint
        - The posterior group further separated into the medial group that adducts the hip, and the posterior group that extends the hip and flexes the knee joint
        - Anterior group (extensors)
            - Sartorius ,longest muscle of the body,medially - originates from ASIS and inserts at the medial side of the tibia, below medial condyle of the tibia. Insertion of sartorius gracilis and semitendinosus mimics the goose feet. Say grace before tea, mnemonic for the insertions at medial condyle of the tibia, from anterior to posterior, it involves 3 muscles from 3 different compartments.
            - Quadriceps femoris - 4 heads, Rectus femoris (o. from the ASIS (sraight head) and the ilium above acetabulum(reflected head), note that it crosses the hip joint.
            - Vastus lateralis (lateral to rectus femoris), Vastus medialis (medial to rectus femoris) and vastus intermedius (deep to rectus femoris) originates from the shaft of femur and associated intermuscular septum.
                - Vastus lateralis originates from the lateral surface of the shaft of the femur, medialis originates from the medial surface of the shaft of femur and medial intermuscuar septum, intermedius originates from anterior surface of femur
            - the 4 heads fuse at the quadriceps tendon, insert at petella, where petella produeces ligamentum patellae that enables quadriceps femoris to insert at the tibia tuberosity
        - Medial compartment (adductors)
            - Pectineus - Originates from the superior ramus of the pubis and inserts at the upper ends of the linea aspera
            - Adductor longus - Originates from the body of the pubis and inserts at the middle 1/3 of the linea aspera
            - Adductor brevis - Deep to the adductor longus, originates from the body and inferior ramus of the pubis, and inserts at the upper 1/3 of the linea aspera
            - Adductor magnus - Overlapped by the 3 aforementioned muscles laterally, it originates from the ischiopubic ramus, and inserts onto the linea aspera (adductor portion) ramus of the pubis (similar to adductor brevis), and inserts onto the medial side of the tibia.
            - Gracilis - Originates from the body and inferior ramus of the pubis, inserts at the medial side of the tibia below the medial condyle. Adducts thigh at hip joint, flexes the knee and medially rotates
        - Posterior compartment (flexors)
            - Also known as the hamstrings
            - The posterior compartment of muscles of the thigh are flexors of the knee joint, and some are extensors of the hip joint.
- 1st gym session since surgery
    - Middle part of deltoid fascilitates abduction from 90 to 150 degrees in shoulder press
    - Did quite well, cardio is poor though
- Compartment syndrome (from gray’s anatomy, the part on the muscles of the thigh)
    - Compartment syndrome occurs when there is swelling within a fascial enclosed muscle compartment in the limbs. Typical causes include limb trauma, intracompartment hemorrhage, and limb compression. As pressure within the compartment elevates, capillary blood flow and tissue perfusion is compromised, which can ultimately lead to neuromuscular damage if not treated.
