- Evergreen
    - [ ]  Gluccocortisoids
- Management of arthritis
    - Paracetamol and NSAID used for analgesic effects in degenerative joint disorders
    - NSAID and steroids are used for anti-inflammatory effects
- Gluccucorticoids
    - Steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [[Glucocorticoid as an anti-inflammatory drug]]
    - MOA
        - Glucocorticoids reaches circulation and diffuses into cells to bind with intracellular receptor
        - The complex translocates into the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor that regulates gene transcription and protein function
            - Its inhibitory effect on protein function implies that there is a slower onset of action (hours to days). This is especially for the effects of inhibiting protein production, where onset of action requires degradation of existing proteins (which then comes down to the half life of these proteins)
        - Gluccocorticoids inhibit eicosanoid production as a whole
            - It stimulates the expression of Lipocortin (Annexin-1), which inhibits phospholipase A2, thus inhibiting the conversion of Membrane phospholipids into arachidonic acid metabolism, thus inhibiting eicosinoid production
            - At a second level, it inhibits the expression of inducible COX-2, thus inhibiting prostanoid synthesis and inflammation
        - At this level, it may seem that Gluccocorticoids and NSAIDS have similar MOA, to inhibit prostanoid production. But what makes gluccocorticoids differ is that it also targets more upstream signalling pathways.
            - By inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and Interleukin-1, thus effectively inhibiting inflammation.

    - Synthetic glucocorticoids are classified by duration of action:
        - Hydrocortisone and prednisolone (short to intermediate acting), but are active drugs
        - Cortisone and prednisone (also short to intermediate acting), but are pro-drugs, requires activation by 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehyrdogenase type 1 (11B-HSD1) in the liver to biologically active form, hydrocortisone and prednisone
            - Avoid in severe liver failure
        - Betamethasone and dexamethasone are long acting
            - Less commonly usede for oral therapy, but usually used for topical therapy
                - This is to avoid systemic adverse effect
    - Endogenous synthesis of glucocorticoids (cortisol) is tightly regulated by the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis [[Cortisol secretion is tightly regulated in the Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis]]
        - Hypothalamus releases corticotrophin-releasing factors, which stimulate the anterior pituitary to release adrenocorticotrophic hormone
        - Once stimulated by adrenocorticotrophic hormone, the adrenal cortex synthesize glucocorticoids (along with mineralocorticoids).
        - Glucocorticoids negatively feedbacks to the hypothalamus, inhibiting its release of corticotrophin-releasing factors to inhibit glucocorticoid production
    - Physiological effects of glucocorticoids [[Glucocorticoid as a hormone]]
        - Believe it or not, the key physiological function of glucocorticoids is not anti-inflammatory. It actually has wide-range effects (glucocortisoids influence almost all cells in the body), ranging from metabolic functions, cardiovascular functions, growth and immunity.
        - Glucocorticoids may have direct effects on cells (which is usually dose-related), but also have permissive effects, they permit the actions of other hormones (at physiological levels of cortisol). Deficiency of glucocorticoids will reduce the actions of other hormones.
        - Permissive effects include: The effects of catacholamines (lipolytic effects, vascular effects), ACTH, growth hormones. The effects of these hormones will be attenuated in the absence of glucocortisoids
    - Metabolic effects of glucocorticoids
        - Direct effects on glucose metabolism, stimulate gluconeogenesis during fasting
            - It stimulates PEPCK, Glucose-6-phosphatase, also stimulates protein cataolism in muscles to provide animo acids for gluconeogenesis.
            - It permits a lipolytic response to other hormones, providing glycerol for gluconeogenesis in the liver, and releases FA into circulation
        - An increase in blood glucose level triggers the release of insulin, but as glucocorticoids promotes translocation of GLUT4 from PM to intracellular locations, glucose uptake and utilization is reduced.
        - This enables delivery of glucose to the brain, significant effects during fasting.
        - The increase in insulin enables lipogenesis, particularly in the trunk (back of neck, face, supraclavicular areas, a redistribution of fats
    - Calcium homeostasis effects of glucocorticoid
        - Inhibits calcium absorption from GI tract
        - Increases calcium excretion by the kidney
        - Osteoporosis
    - Renal functions of glucocorticoids
    - Other effects
        - Permissive effects to vascular response to catacholamines
        - CNS disturbance by affecting neuronal survival and activity
    - Risk of chronic use of anti-inflammatory steroids
        - Infections and peptic ulcer
        - Impaired wound healing
        - CNS disturbance - insomnia, euphoria, adepression
        - Osteoporosis - inhibits vitamin D activity in osteoblast and effects on calcium metabolism
        - Hyperglycemia â†’ DM, due to effects on gluconeogenesis
        - Muscle wasting and weakness, due to effects of protein metabolism
        - Redistribution of fat
    - Precautions of glucocorticoids
        - Children - growth inhibition with chronic use
        - Pre-existing conditions
            - Peptic ulcer
            - heart disease
            - Infectious disease
            - Psychoses
            - DM
            - Osteoporosis
            - Hepatic dysfunction
    - Adrenal insufficiency
        - Chronic use of glucocorticoids results in supressed HPA axis, resulting in adrenal insufficiency
        - This results in disturbances in fluid and electrolytes
        - Hypoglycaemia
        - And attenuated response of other hormones
            - e.g. circulatory shock due to impaired vasoactive response to glucose
    - Requires graded reduction of glucocorticoid therapy, 2-12 months for recovery of adrenal functions, another 6-9 months for recovery of corticosteroids level
