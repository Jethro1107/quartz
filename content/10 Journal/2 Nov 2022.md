- [[Urate-lowering agents]]  are used in the management of chronic tophaceous gout and in the intercritical gout
    - In general, urate-lowering agents are used in the management in the long term management of gout, to decrease the frequency of acute gouty flares and slow progression to chronic tophaceous gout
    - There are 3 classes of urate-lowering agents: Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinols), Uricosuric agents (probenecid, benzbromarone, lesinurad), Uricolytic agents
    - These urate-lowering agents are avoided in acute gouty arthritis as they precipitate acute gouty flares
        - A sudden reduction in serum uric acid levels will cause the urate crystals that has already precipitated in the joint to dissolve back into tissues.
        - Uric acid travels via plasma and precipitates in other joints, i.e. There is a mobilization of urate from tissue deposits to joints. This precipitates as acute gouty flares. There are 2 implications in this:
            - Urate-lowering drugs are to be avoided in treatment of acute gouty arthritis
            - Initial therapy for long term management of gout used in conjunction with anti-inflammatory drugs, until the risk of gouty flares is reduced, when there is a decrease in excess tissue stores of uric acid
    - Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, e.g. Allopurinols, febuxostate
        - MOA - They modify uric acid metabolism.
            - Allopurinols is bioactivated into alloxanthines by xanthine oxidase.
            - Alloxanthine then serves as a non-competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, which inhibits the breakdown of hypoxanthine into uric acids.
            - This results in decreased uric acid synthesis, but results in elevated serum xanthine levels, which results in renothialisis, i.e. xanthine stones.
                - Avoided by drinking more water, to maintain a high urine volume an hence a low xanthine concentration in urine
                - Or by maintaining a higher urine pH.
        - Adverse effects
            - Other than renal stones and nephrothialisis, each drug carries particular risk
            - Allopurinols
                - Gastrointestinal disturbance (nausea, vommitting, diarrhoea)
                - Contraindicated in pregnancy and in children
                - Hypersensitivity reaction, risk of SJS, which is associated with HLA-B*5801 allele, with high prevalence in people of southeast Asian ancestry and African americans â†’ Suggest HLA screening before initiation of allopurinol therapy
                - Dose adjustment in patients with renal impairments
            - Febuxostat
                - Liver function abnormalities, requires monitoring of liver functions
                - Nausea, joint pain, rash
                - Increased risk of MI stroke, regular monitoring for cardiovacular complications
    - Uricosuric Agents e.g. Probenecid, benzbromarone, lesinurad
        - Probenecid most commonly used
        - Overall effect: Increases renal excretion of uric acid, resulting in decrease serum urate levels
            - It inhibits the reabsorption of uric acid via UAT1 in the PCT, resultin in increased urate acid excretion.
            - However, increased uric acid concentration can also cause uric acid stones, which is counteracted by drinking more water, increasing urine volume and decreasing the concentration of uric acid in urine.
        - Adverse effect
            - Drug interactions, inhibition of urate-anion exchanger system, results in inhibition of secretion of organic anions, i.e. Drugs methotrexate, penicillin, glucuronide metabolites of NSAID
            - Probenecid overdose can cause fatal outcomes, CNS stimulation, convulsions and respiratory failure
            - GI disturbance
    - Uricolytic agents
        - Rasburicase - recombinant mamalllian urate oxidase, shorter duration of action
        - Pegloticase - recombinant mammalian urate oxidase that is covalently attached to methoxypolyethylene glycol, prolong circulating half-life nd diminished immunogenic response
        - MOA
            - They break down uric acid into allantoin, resulting in decreased plasma level of uric acid
        - Precaution
            - Avoid in patients with G^PD deficiency, as risk of hemolytic anemia nd risk of methemoglobinemia (due to formtation of hydrogen peroxide
        - Adverse effect
            - Severe allergic reactions
            - Infusion reactions
            - Limited usage in Mx of gout, peglooticse only for thos refractory to other urate lowering therapy, rasburicase for those with elevated plasma uric acid levels due to chemotherapy
