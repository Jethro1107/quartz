- Gastrointestinal tract infections/ Enteric infections
    - GI infections can be classified as non-inflammatory GI infections, inflammatory GI infections and penetrating GI infections, which can be *distinguished by incubation period, symptomatology and the exposure history*.
        - Non-inflammatory GI infections are usually mediated by secretory toxins, e.g. Cholera toxins from Vibrio cholerae, and secretory toxins produced by enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC).
            - Short incubation period (1 to 6 hours)
            - The common complaint is watery diarrhoea (usually ETEC or Vibrio cholerae) or vomiting (usually S. aureus and bacillus cereus).
            - As it is non-inflammatory, there is no faecal leukocytes on stool examination.
            - Pathogenesis - Enterotoxin (secretory toxins) mediated at the proximal small bowel.
