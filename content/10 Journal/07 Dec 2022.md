- [[Cerebrospinal fluid]]
	- Cerebral spinal fluid is an ultrafiltrate of the plasma derived from plasma at the choroid plexus within cerebral ventricles ([[Ventricular system]])
	- Roughly 150ml in adults, 2/3 within the spine
	- Composition
		- Minimal protein
		- 2/3 glucose
		- Lacks RBC
		- WBC <5/mm3
		- Less Ca2+ and K+
		- More Cl-
	- Apearance:
		- Normally clear and colourless
	- Functions of CSF
		- Provides buoyancy and support for the brain
		- Cushions and protects the CNS from trauma
		- Homeostasis - maintains a steady biochemical and physical environment
		- Clearance of metabolic waste via the glymphatic system into CSF, then blood
- [[Ventricular system]]
	- The ventricular system is a system of 4 connected cavities in the brain that houses cerebrospinal fluid
	- It consists of 2 Lateral ventricles, a 3rd ventricle and a 4th ventricle
	- The 2 lateral ventricles are located in the cerebral hemispheres as C-shaped cavities in the parietal lobe, with 3 horns: A frontal horn, an occipital horn and a temporal horn, that passes into the respective lobes.
	- The 3rd ventricle is a cleft-shaped cavity between the two thalamus
	- The 4th ventricle lies between the open medulla and the cerebellum
	- CSF is produced by the [[Choroid plexus]] in all 4 ventricles.
	- Cerebral aqueduct, interventricular foramina of Monro, then descends through spinal canal.
	- Through 2 lateral apertures (Foramen of Luschka) and a median aperture (Foramen of Mangendie) at lower brainstem, drains into subarachnoid space in head and neck

- Arterial supply of the brain ^79800a
	- The brain is supplied by 4 arteries: the 2 internal carotid arteries, the 2 vertebral arteries
	- The internal carotid arteries ascend through the neck, and enters the skull via the carotid canal in the temoral lobe, which branches to give the opthalmic artery, the anterior cerebral artery, the middle cerebral artery, brain perforators...
	- Anterior cerebral artery
		- runs within the interhemispheric fissure between the two cerebral hemispheres, curving around the corpus callosum
		- It innervates the anterior and superior cerebum (medially)
	- Middle cerebral artery
		- Runs in the lateral sulcus between the frontal lobe and temporal lobe
		- Gives perforating branches such as lenticulostriate arteries that supply the deep structures of the cerebrum
		- As it emerges superficially, deep branches supply the lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere
