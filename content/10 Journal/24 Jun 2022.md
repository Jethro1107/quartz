### Murmurs

Mitral stenosis - Low pitched late diastolic murmur with opening snap? (as atrial contraction occurs in late diastole?)

Mitral regurgitation - Systolic murmur with a blowing quality

Aortic regurgitation - Early Diastolic murmur that is best heard at left parasternal border 3/4th intercostal space (radiates there)

Aortic stenosis - Systolic murmur, radiates to carotids, pulses parvus et tardus (peripheral pulses are often weak and delayed), S2 is deminished

### ECG

### The ECG is an electrical snapshot of the heart

### Leads and electrodes are different - a 12-lead ECG is created by analysis of 10 electrodes

Electrodes are conductive pads that attach to the skin to enable the recording of electrical segments

Leads are graphical representation of the electrical activity (an electrical view of the heart) that is created by analysing several electrodes

### Connecting the electrodes to get the 12 leads

10 electrodes are connected to create the 12 leads (12 views of the heart), the 5 limb leads and 6 precordial leads (chest leads)

Limb leads:

Using four electrodes on our four limbs, it produces 6 frontal leads that look at our heart at a vertical plane

The four electrodes, colour coded: 黃綠醫生 左手左腳 紅天黑地 右手右腳

![[Untitled 1]]

The 6 frontal planes are: Lead I, Lead II, Lead III, aVR, aVL, aVF

![[Untitled 1]]

Lead I, Lead II and Lead III are bipolar limb leads that require a positive and a negative electrode

aVR, aVL and aVF are unipolar limb leads that require only a positive electrode (the negative electrode is the average from the two other limb electrodes)

Chest leads: 

V1 - right sternal border, 4th intercostal space

V2 - left sternal border, 4th intercostal space

V3 - Between V2 and V3

V4 - Left 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line

V5 - Between V6 and V6

V6 - 5th intercostal space mid-axillary line

### Different parts of the ECG

P wave - Atrial depolarization

PR segment - From the end of P wave to the start of the QRS complex

PR interval (more commonly used) - From beginning of P wave to the beginning of QRS complex, it indicates the time taken for SA node to fire an action potential, spread through the atrial muscles, the AV node and bundle of His to depolarize the the ventricle

The PR interval is very short: 0.12-0.2 seconds only (3-5 small boxes)

QRS complex - Ventricular depolarization (not contraction)

Q wave - Septal depolarization from left to right, the 1st negative deflection

R wave - 1st positive deflection (regardless of the presence of Q wave)

S wave - 2nd negative deflection beyond isoelectric line (must follow R wave)

The QRS complex normally is 0.12s (3 small boxes)

ST segment - From the end of the QRS complex and the start of T wave, indicating ventricular contraction

QT interval - From the beginning of QRS complex to the end of T wave

Male <0.44s

Female <0.46s

Rate sensitive - calculate QTc (corrected QT intervals)

### Approaching in ECG

An ECG should be approached in the same way (RRPWQST)

Rate - Calculated by box method (300/number of large boxes) or number of R waves

Rhythm - regular or irregular?

P wave - Is P wave present? and is each QRS complex preceded by P wave? Multiple P waves? Is it sinus rhythm

Width of QRS complex - Wide or narrow complex?

Q wave - Is there deep Q wave, indicative of old myocardial infarction

ST segment changes - isoelectric, elevated or depressed? indicating ischaemia and infarction

T wave changes - Normally inverted in aVR and lead I, inverted indicates ischaemia

### QRS complex in limb leads - Cardiac axis

Cardiac axis is determined by limb leads:

Lead II should be predominantly positive (R>S)

aVR should be predominantly negative (S>R)

Normal cardiac axis is assessed by leads I, II and III:

![[Untitled 1]]

Lead I, II, and III is predominantly positive

In right ventricle hypertrophy, the hypertrophied right ventricle exerts a greater effect on QRS complex than the left ventricle

1. This causes lead I to be predominantly negative
2. This causes lead III to become more positive than lead II

It is said that there is right axis deviation

### QRS complex in precordial leads

Progression from predominantly negative in V1 to predominantly positive in V6
