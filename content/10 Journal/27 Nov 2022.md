    - Diagnosis 101
        - Like how screening is the pressumptive identification of an unrecognised disease in an otherwise healthy individual in the application of tests, examinations and procedures, Diagnosis also applies test
        - Diagnosis is not pressumptive, but definitive. It is defined as the process of determining health status and the factors responsible for producing it.
        - While u apply “diagnostic tests” when u want to make a definitive diagnosis, different diagnostic tests are built different, and thus have different functions:
            - A test with high positive LR (>10) is used to make a definitive diagnosis.
            - A test with low LR- (<0.1) is used to rule out a diagnosis
        - LR describes the performance of test
            - [[Chemical pathology]] notes has a section with LR
            - A function of SN and SP
        - How is LR applied: post-test odds
            - Pre-test **odds (requires conversion to odds)** - by prevalence
            - Pretest times likelihood ratio = post-test odds
        - Diagnosis with multiple tests
            - As multiple tests may be required due to intermediate LRs and predictive values:
                - Parallel testing increases sensitivity and negative predictive values, but increases FP
                - Serial testing increases specificity and positive predictive values, but increases FN
        -

    - Prognosis 101
        - The likely course and outcome of a health condition over time
            - Clinical course - prognosis with medical care
            - Natural history prognosis without medical intervention
        - Studies of prognosis
            - Average/overall prognosis
            - Prognostic factors
            - Risk prediction models
        - Best study type for prognosis - cohort studies

            Inception cohort - cohort identified and assembled for subsequent study at an early and uniform point in the course of the specific health condition (soon after dx, or early after onset of symptoms)
            
            - This prevents selection bias caused by early death or early recovery of some patients
        - Outcome studied:
            - Mortality
                - Can be extracted from misclassification
                - All cause
                - disease-specific mortality - prone to misclassification
            - Standardised mortality ratio (SMR)
            - CFR (Case fatality rate
- [[Diagnosis]]
    - Diagnosis is the application of tests to determining the health status of an individual and the factors for producing it.
    - Evaulating diagnostic tests
        - Validity: Sensitivity and specificity… Specificity is favoured to rule out a diagnosis (narrowing a differential diagnosis)
        - Predictive values used to evaluate likelihood of patient having the disease for a given result
- The thing we want to know most after applying a diagnostic test is the post-test probability … we just want to make/ rule out a diagnosis.
    - Two factors is at play: pre-test odds (requires conversion to odds), and likelihood ratio
    - Pre-test probability is estimated by prevelance… As predictive values, especially PPV, depends largely on the prevalence of disease in population, the greater the pre-test probability, the better the positive predictive values.
    - Post-test odds = LR x pre-test odds
        - [[There are different methods of appraising post-test probability after the application of diagnostic tests]].
            - By Predictive values - predictive values is a direct estimate of post test probability
            - By Likelihood ratios - by multiplying LR and pre-test odds (estimated from prevalence)
        - Serial testing and parallel testing to increase post-test probability
            - Effects
- [[Likelihood ratio]]
    - Two use cases: appraising the performance of a diagnostic test by relating probablity of a test result (positive or negative) in someone with disease to someone without disease
        - LR+/LR-
- [[Prognosis]]
    - Prognosis refers to the most likely course and outcome of a disease over  time.
    - There are two types of prognosis
        - Clinical course - prognosis with medical care
        - Natural history - prognosis without medical care
    - 3 things we want to know about prognosis
        - What is overall/average prognosis
        - What are prognostic factors
        - Any risk prediction models
    - Gold standard for studying prognosis - cohort studies (especially those that assemble an inception cohort)
        - They give the best evidence, give prognosis and prognosis factors
        - Inception cohort is assembled
    - Mortality is the most common outcome when studying prognosis
        - Mortality can be extracted from death certificates
        - Processed into:
            - All-cause mortality
            - Disease-specific mortality
        - Use standardised mortality ratio and case fatality rate:
            - to study risk of exposure (i.e. disease)
            - SMR: observed deaths/expected deaths (age and geneder specific)
            - CFR - number of deaths/ number of diagnosed cases during the study
    - Studying survival
        - studies different factors (prognostic factors, treatment etc) on survival (outcome)

- [[Myasthesia gravis]]
    - Myasthesia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorder.
    - Pathogenesis
        - Individual produces pathogenic antibodies, such as Anti-AChR autoantibodies, Anti-Lrp4 autoantibodies, Anti-MuSK antibodies.
        - Anti-AChR autoantibodies mediates its effects in 3 ways:
            - It results in formation of membrane attacking complexes, which results in disruption of post-synaptic membrane structure.
            - It results in the endocytosis of AChR, resulting in reduce density of AChR clusters
            - It alters functions of AChR as a channel
        - This inhibits neurotransmission across the NMJ, thus resulting in progressive muscle weakness.
    - Clinical course
        - Progressive disease, with initial occular features, folowed by ocular symptoms, (eyelid drooping, blurred or double vision, weakness of the muscle controlling eyeballs) and subsequent development of generalised muscle weakness in all muscles.
