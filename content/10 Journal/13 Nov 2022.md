- [[Intervertebral disc]]
    - Fibrocartilage pads between 2 adjacent vertebral bodies from C2 to the sacrum.
    - Intervertebral discs consist an inner nucleus pulposus and an outer annulus fibrosis
    - The outer annulus fibrosis consist of concentric lamellae of fibrocartilage, where the fibres run obliquely from one vertebral body to another. This arrangement of fibres limits lateral rotation of vertebral bodies.
    - The inner nucleus pulposus  consist of hydrated HA-aggrecan aggregates (proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycan), providing compressive resistance. Serves as a shock absorber for vertical forces.
- [[Normal curvature of the vertebral column]]
    - The vertebral column is not a straight structure but exhibits curvature at different regions, notably, the cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis and sacral kyphosis.
    - Kyphosis refers to the curvature that concaves anteriorly, while lordosis refers to the curvature that concaves posteriorly.
    - Thoracic and sacral kyphosis are primary curvatures as they develop in fetal period.
    - Cervical and lumbar lordosis are secondary curvatures as they develop during infancy and childhood. Think the excitement of parents when the baby raise their head or sit up for the first time.
- [[Ligaments of the vertebral column]]
    - Anterior longitudinal ligaments
        - Strong, broad fibrous band that covers the anterolateral surfaces of the vertebral body and the intervertebral disc, extending from the anterior surface of the sacrum to the anterior tubercle of C1. This ligament prevents hyperextension of the vertebral column.
    - Posterior longitudinal ligament
        - Weaker, narrower band than the ALL. It covers the posterior surface of the vertebral body and intervertebral disc, from posterior aspect of vertebral body of C2 to the sacrum.
        - It weakly prevents hyperflexion of the vertebral column, and opposes posterior herniation of the nucleus pulposus
    - Intertransverse ligament
        - Between the transverse process
    - Interspinous ligament
        - Connects adjacent spinous process
    - Supraspinous process
        - Connects spinous process from C7 to the sacrum, bridges superiorly with the nuchal ligament of the head and neck
    - Ligamentum flavum
        - Yellow ligament connects adjacent laminae
- [[Joints of the vertebral bodies are known as symphysis]]
    - The vertebral bodies are connected via intervertebral discs, which forms a cartilaginous joint known as a symphysis.
    - Stabilized by anterior and posterior longitudinal ligament that limits flexion and extension.
- [[Joints of the vertebral arch are synovial joints]]
    - The joints of the vertebral arch refer to the articulation between articular facets of superior and inferior articular processes of adjacent vertebrae.
    - The joints are called zygapophysial joints (facet joints), which are classified as synovial plane joints. The orientation of facet joints determines the types of movement allowed.
- Muscles of the back
    - Extrinsic back muscles - Trapezius, latissimus dorsi, Rhomboid, levator scapulae, they produce upper limb movement.
    - [[Intrinsic back muscles]]  (deep back muscles or muscles of the back proper) are those that maintain posture of vertebral column, and control movements of the vertebral column.
    - They are innervated by the posterior rami of spinal nerves
    - Three layers
        - Superficial layer of intrinsic back muscles is formed by splenius muscle
            - Collective origin from the nuchal ligament and spinous process of C7 to t6
            - Splenius capitis - Inserts at the head
            - Splenius cervicis - Inserts at the transverse process of C1 to C3/4
            - Movement:
                - Bilateral: Extension
                - Unilateral: Rotation and lateral flexion of head and necl
        - Intermediate layer is formed by the erectorspinae
            - From lateral to medial: iliocostalis, longissimus, spinalis
                - Span from head to sacrum
            - Movement:
                - Bilateral, extension of head, neck and vertebral column
                - Unilateral: Lateral flexion of Head neck and vertebral column
                - Constantly contracte to help us oppose gravity, hold the spine upright
        - Deep layer of intrinsic back muscles:
            - Transversospinalis: semispinalis, multifidus, rotators
            - Interspinales
            - Intertransversarii
            - Levatores costarum
            - Similar movement as the erector spinae, but operates at a vertebral level
        - Flexors of spine
            - Head and neck: Scalene, SCM, longus coli
            - Trunk:
                - Psoas major and rectus abdominis
- [[Scottie dog sign is a normal sign for the lumbar vertebrae]]
    - Scottie dog sign refers to the normal characteristic of the lumbar vertebrae when viewed obliquely (posterolateral view.
        - The transverse process is the nose
        - The pedicle is the eye
        - The pars interarticularis is the neck
        - The inferior articular process is front leg
        - The spinous process is its short tail
- Histology of joint - cartilage + synovium
    - [[Cartilage]] is essentially a specialised connective tissue consisting of chondrocytes and cartilage matrix. It is avascular.
    - [[Nutrient cycle of the articular cartilage requires mechanical loading at the joint]]
        - Cartilage acquires nutrients from the synovial fluid
        - During physiological loading, synovial fluid is pushed into cartilage, enabling chondrocytes to acquire nutrients.
        - During unloading, the metabolites diffuse back out to the synovial fluid.
    - Cartilage serves as a shock absorber, due to its compressive resistance.
    - Cartilage zones:
        1. Gliding zones - cells are paralell to surface
        2. Transitional zone - Chondrocytes stack on top of each other
        3. Tidemark - Separates the non-calcified cartilage and calcified cartilage
        4. Zone of calcified cartilage - purple indicates calcification
        5. Under the cartilage, subchondral bone
    - Cartilage consist of chondrocytes and cartilage matrix
        - In a normal articular cartilage, it there is a normal homeostasis between synthesis and degradation of cartilage matrix
        - Disrupted cartilage homeostasis underlies the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis ([[Pathogenesis and pathology of osteoarthritis]])
            - Abnormal loading interfers the nutrition cycle of chondrocytes, which will eventually destabilize cartilage homeostasis: Degradation > Synthesis
            - In overloading, excess pressure kills of chondrocytes and obliterateed joint space means they can’t get nutrients
            - In underloading, not enough pressure to push synovial fluid into cartilage, resulting in poor nutrition for chondrocytes. This results in decreased synthesis of cartilage matrix. At the same time, there is breakdown of matrix, mediated by stromolysin (MMP), that cleaves type II collagen. They lose the framework, that results in fibrillation, cracks, erosion.
                - This enables water to move into the matrix, resulting in cysts?
                - Furthermore, degradation of aggrecans results in more abnormal loading
            - Disease occurs when degradation exceeds synthesis
        - In response to injury:
            - Osteophyte formation - as a physiologcal response to increase surface area, stabilize the joint, distribute stress, but ineffective and painful. In the DIP, Herberden’s node, in PIP joint, Buchen node
            - Sclerosis - fibrosis of bone under the cartilage, but interferes with chondrocyte nutritions
            - Subchondral cyst - high stress on the will cause cyst formation in the body
        - Histologically: Fibrillation, cracks, erosions of articular cartilage. Eburnation - exposure of subchondral bone.
        - Histopathology:

- Rheumatoid arthritis
    - Rheumatoid arthritis is a common, chronic, symmetrical polyarthritis. The commonest autoimmune inflammatory arthritis
    
    ![[Untitled 1]]
    
    - Clinical courses
        - Usually manifests as a chronic symmetrical polyarthritis, usually involving the metacarpophalangeal joints and the PIP joints, metatarsophalangeal joints, elbows, knees
        - ACPA and RF usually positive, even before clinical disease
    - Pathogenesis
        - Environmental factor and genetic predisposition
        - 1st hit at mucosal levels, cause dendritic cells and APC to present citrullinated proteins to the lymphocytes, resulting in formation of ACPA.
        - 2nd hit at the joint, as minor joint trauma results in the increased expression of citrullinated proteins in the joints. This is largely due to Oc expressing enzymes that increase citrullination. ACPA can enter to attack these epitopes.
        - Macrophage infiltration → release proinflammatory cytokines, TNFalpha and IL-1. They trigger release of enzymes (Ptoyrsdrz) by synovial cells and also recruit circulating monocytes, accentuate macrophage iinfiltration. Extent of macrophage infiltration also determines the clinical activity of the disease. Hence TNF-alpha antagonist as bDMARDs proven benificial.
        - Pannus formation, granulation tissue, synovial cells, inflammatory cells cause death of cartilage, narrowing of joint space. May also bridge bone, fibrous ankylosis and ossified into bony ankylosis.
    - Pathology - Synovium  becomes  thickened, with papillary formation
    - Histopathology - Hyperplasia of synovium with polypoid, papillary fronds
        - Vascularised stroma
        - Dense inflammatory infiltrates, with plasma cells, lymphocytes
        - Together, a pannus, i.e. edematous synovium, granulation tissue, iflammatory cells that erode through the articular cartilage. Pannus can bridge through the bone to form a fibrous ankylosis, later ossify as bony ankylosis
        - ACPA activate:
            - Osteoclastic activity, periarticular erosions
            - Fibroblast activation synovial proliferation → Granulation tissue
            - RF against Fc portion of their own IgG (Fc portion the same in the same class), can also form immune complexes.
- [[Pathogenesis and pathology of rheumatoid arthritis]]
    - Pathogenesis
        - Exposure of environmental allergen in a genetically predisposed individual at the mucosal level results in the presentation of citrullinated proteins by APC and dendritic cells to lymphocytes, resulting in production Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA)
        - Minor joint trauma may result in expression of citrullinated proteins such as collagen II or vimentin, which are then attacked by ACPA.
        - ACPA triggers macrophage infiltration, which releases pro-inflammatory cytokines.
            - They also activate fibroblasts in the formation of pannus
            - Pannus formed, granulation tissue with inflammatory cells, edemetous synovium. It erodes into articular cartilage.
        - ANCA also results in osteoclast activation, which results in osteopenia of periarticular bone.
    - Histopathology
        - Proliferation of synovium into polypoidal or papillary fronds
        - Pannus formation eroding into the cartilage.
    - Pathology
        - Papillary synvoium
        - Periarticular bone erosion
- [[Rheumatoid arthritis]]
    - Radiological features
        - Soft tissue swelling and widened joint space initially
            - This is due to synovial inflammation and effusion
        - Juxta-articular bone osteoporosis
            - Hyperaemia and disuse
        - Joint space narrowing
            - Due to pannus eroding through the articular cartilage
        - Periarticular erosions
            - Osteoclastic activity in pannus eroding through bones within the joint capsule.
