- [[Motor system]]
	- 3 carnial areas of the brain is responsible for motor functions:
		- [[Motor cortex]]:
			- The human motor cortex is not merely the primary motor cortex
			- The motor cortex consists of:
				- **Primary motor cortex** (M1 or Broadmann Area 4, in precentral gyrus), the pyramidal cells of the priary motor cortex gives rise to the [[Pyramidal system]]. i.e. the primary motor cortex is responsible for executive functions
				- Supplementary motor area (SMA): responsible for planning and sequencing of movement
				- Premotor area (PMA): for integration of sensory and motor information
			- Motor cortex gives rise to the pyramidal system
				- executes action via the [[Pyramidal system]], movement also supported by extrapyramidal system
		- Basal ganglia (Extrapyramidal system)
		- Cerebellum (Extrapyramidal system)
- The motor homunculus roughly delineates a map of repertoires of movement in M1
	- Medially, a small area is responsible for lower limb movements
	- Extending laterally, a large area is responsible for upper limb, predominantly to the distal ends
	- Most laterally, it is a large area for the faces, speech functions
	- But practically, it is highly variable:
		- During surgery, it is mapped out by electrical stimulation and recording.
- Pyramidal system
	- The pyramidal system involves the transmission of motor signals to the muscles
	- Comprises of the corticobulbar tract and corticospinal tract
	- Corticospinal tract
		- The corticospinal tract consists of the axons of UMN (Pyramidal cells) that extend to the spinal cord
		- Responsible for movement of the limbs and trunk
		- Refering to the motor homunculus, the pyramidal cells comprising the corticospinal tract are more medially (i.e. excluding those to the head and neck)
		- Course
			- Pyramidal cells (UMN) of layer V of cerebral cortex in M1 (those responsible for limbs and trunk) projects looooonnnnnngggggg axons
			- They twist and pass in the corona radiata, and converge into the [[Internal capsule]], in a way that LL UMN pass posteriorly, and the fascial UMN pass anteriorly
			- Pass through cerebral peduncle of the the midbrain, through the pontine nucleus of pons, and in the pyramids of the medulla
			- **Decussation**
				- 80% of fibres decussate at the pyramids to the contralateral lateral corticospinal tract
				- 20% of fibres descend in the ipsilateral ventral corticospinal tract, but decussate last minute at the spinal level
				- It should be noted that the lateral corticospinal tract are responsible for controlling distal limb muscles, while anterior corticospinal tract are responsible for trunk and proximal limb muscles.
				- From an evolutionary standpoint, the ratio of decussation at pyramids underlie how advance a species is: high degree of decussation, results in high proportion of fibres to the lateral tract, which indicates a higher fine motor control
		- Corticobulbar tracts
			- Descending pathway to motor cranial nerve nuclei
			- UMN (pyramidal cells) of the lateral most side of M1 sends axon to cranial nerve nuclei, which synapse with lower motor neurons within the head and neck, which subsequently send axons to muscles of the head and neck
			- Cranial nerves involved:
				- Trigeminal nerve
				- Fascial nerve
				- Glossopharyngeal nerve
				- Vagus nerve
				- Spinal accessory nerve
				- Hypoglossal nerve
			- The LMN in the motor cranial nerve nuclei in general is supplied by contralateral upper motor neuron and ipsilateral upper motor neuron
			- With the exception of lower fascial nucleus, and the hypoglossal nucleus (which are only innervated by the contralateral upper motor neuron lesion)
				- Fascial nerve palsy
					- Central cause of fascial nerve palsy, e.g. stroke.
						- The upper fascial nucleus is compensated by the ipsilateral upper motor neuron, and hence they are able to move their upper face, particularly the ability to close their eyes
						- However, as the lower fascial nucleus is not compensated by the ipsilateral upper motor neuron, resulting in lower muscle weakness, manifesting as a drooping mouth
					- Peripheral fascial nerve palsy (e.g. Bells palsy or peripheral fascial nerve injury), results in transaction of fascial nerve, such that both the upper and lower motor neurons are affected.
- [[Basal ganglia]]
	- A collection of nerve cells at the base of the brain, deep in the white cortex of the cerebral hemisphere
	- Part of the extrapyramidal motor system
	- [[The basal ganglia initiates learned motor patterns or coordinates parallel or sequential motor patterns to accomplish purposeful tasks]].
		- **Putamen circuitry initiates execution of learned motor patterns**
			- When the cerebral cortex, particularly the premotor cortex and supplementary motor areas, and the somatosensory areas generate the desire to move, they stimulate the putamen.
			- The putamen passes to the internal globus pallidus, which project to the ventral lateral subnucleus of the thalamus, which then projects to  to the primary motor cortex, and portions of premotor cortex, and SMA.
			- This is ccompanied by ancillary circuits that pass from putamen, to external globus pallidus, subthalamic nuclei and substantia nigra that return to the motor cortex by way of the thalamus
		- **Caudate circuitry is involved in cognitive coordination of sequential motor patterns**
			- The C-shape caudate nucleus receives signals from all association areas of the cerebral cortex overlying the caudate nucleus, integrating the different types of sensory and motor information into usable thought patterns
			- It then transmits to the internal globus pallidus, which passes to the ventroanterior and ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus that projects to prefrontal, premotor and supplementarl areas of the cerebral cortex, but none pass directly to the M1.
			- Instead, the premotor and SMA essentialy put together the learned motor patterns into a sequence of movements,
