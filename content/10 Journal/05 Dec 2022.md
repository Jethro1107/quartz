- Truly start learning [[HNNS]]
	- A primer to neuroanatomy, and understanding the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system. I believe that while brain functions (physiology) seems to be complicated, a good understanding of neuroanatomy can probably explain like 70-80% of neural physiology.
	- Then with physiology, we can then understand the pathology and so on...
- [[Brainstem]]
	- The brainstem consist of 3 regions: the midbrain, the pons and the medullar oblongta
	- Collectively, you can consider the brainstem consists of neuronal cell bodies (aggregate into nucleus) and axonal fibres. This is quite similar to the components of a spinal cord (and the brain for that matter).
	- To put it simply, the brainstem is the *spinal cord of the head and neck*
	- Major functions of the brain stem:
		- It conveys all ascending and descending pathways
		- It consists of nuclei of most cranial nerves
		- Mainy important life centres are located in the brainstem, either as nuclei and cranial nerves, or within the reticular formation.
	- The textbook clinical _neurology and neuroanatomy_ describes an approach to learning the brain stem:
		- Understanding the brainstem requires a general framework for _what_ is there and _where_ it is. As far as _what_ is in the brainstem, there are five general categories of structures:
			1.  The descending motor pathways for the extremities and torso (**corticospinal tracts; see Ch. 4**)
			2.  The ascending somatosensory pathways from the extremities and torso (**dorsal columns and spinothalamic tracts; see Ch. 4**)
			3.  The **cranial nerve nuclei** and associated structures
			4.  Connections with the cerebellum (the **cerebellar peduncles**; see [Ch. 8](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?legacysectionid=berkneuro_ch8)
			5.  The reticular activating system and ascending neurotransmitter-specific projection pathways: **substantia nigra** ([dopamine](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426587)), **locus coeruleus** ([norepinephrine](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426819)), **median raphe nuclei** (serotonin), **pedunculopontine nuclei** ([acetylcholine](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/drugs.aspx?GbosID=426063))
		- As points of orientation for _where_ structures are in the brainstem, the following principles apply at all three levels of the brainstem ([Fig. 9–1](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?bookid=1984&sectionid=147771020#berkneuro_ch9fg1)):
			-   The corticospinal tracts run in the _anterior (ventral)_ aspect of the brainstem.
			-   The somatosensory pathways for the extremities and torso move a bit over the course of their ascent, but are most often _posterior (dorsal)_ within the brainstem (with the exception of the mid-medulla, where the medial lemnisci are medial and extend anteriorly; see [Ch. 4](https://accessmedicine-mhmedical-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?legacysectionid=berkneuro_ch4)).
			-   The cranial nerve nuclei are all _posterior (dorsal)_.
			    -   In general, the motor cranial nerve nuclei are closest to the midline, and their cranial nerves emerge medially/anteriorly (CN 4 is an exception in that it exits posteriorly).
			        -   The motor cranial nerve nuclei innervating _skeletal_ muscle are at the midline: CNs 3, 4, and 6 (innervating extraocular muscles) and CN 12 (innervating tongue muscles).
			        -   The motor cranial nerve nuclei innervating _branchial_ muscles are more lateral: CN 7 (facial muscles), CN 5 (jaw muscles), and CNs 9 and 10 (muscles of the larynx/pharynx)
			    -   The sensory and special sensory cranial nerve nuclei are all more lateral than the motor cranial nerve nuclei: sensory nuclei of CN 5, vestibular and cochlear nuclei (CN 8), and nucleus solitarius (for taste and visceral sensation)
			-   The cerebellar peduncles all arise from the posterior/dorsal brainstem (logically, since the cerebellum is posterior to the brainstem)
			-   The ascending neurotransmitter-specific projection pathways are found throughout the brainstem, but the reticular-activating system involved in maintaining arousal and consciousness reside in the upper pons and midbrain.
	- Surface anatomy of the brainstem
		- Medullar oblongata
			- Anterior features
				- Characterised by the many cranial nerves protruding anteriorly from medulla
				- The anterior medial fissure (extends down the spinal cord)
				- Pyramid - pyramidal structure, consists of decussation of pyramid, where the nerve fibres cross path, causing the left brain to innervate the left side of the body, and vice versa.
			- Lateral features
				- Olive, a collection of mtor nerves passing through
			- Posterior features
				- Cuneate tubercle laterally, gracile tubercle medially and a posterior median fissure.
				- Inferior cerebellar pudencle
			- The medullar oblongata forms the floor of the 4th ventricle (a part of the [[Cerebrospinal fluid pathway]])
		- Pons
			- Anteriorly defined by the large trigeminal nerve conveyed from pons
			- Posteriorly defined with the superior cerebellar peduncle, middle cerebellar peduncle and (peduncle - bundle of nerve fibres, i.e. connections with cerebellum, each accompanied by its cerebellar artery)
		- Midbrain
			- Consist of cerebral peduncle
			- Anteriorly
				- Interpeduncular fossa
				- Oculomotor nerve
			- Posteriorly
				- Superior colliculus
				- Inferior colliculus
				- Trochlear nerve (only cranial nerve protruding posterior of the brain stem)
	- Internal structures of the brainstem
		- Medulla oblongata
			- Descending pathways:
				- Corticospinal tract descends ventrally in the medullary pyramids, at the junction between the medulla and the spinal cord, the axonal tracts decussate, crossing paths
				- Descending spinal tract of V
				- tectospinal tract
			- Ascending pathways
				- The dorsal medial lemniscus tract ascends up the medulla oblongata (dorsally), and decussate at internal arcuate fibres and relay to the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus
				- The dorsal spinothalamic tract ascends continue into the inferior cerebellar tract
			- Cranial nerve nuclei
				- Hypoglosseal nucleus, Dorsal motor nucleus of vagus and the nucleus ambiguus are typically found in the medulla, grouped around the central canal dorsally, and fotmd the floor of 4th medulla
				- Inferior olivary nucleus in the olive
				- Trigeminal nucleus laterally in the middle/lower medullar oblongata
- [[Cranial nerves]]
