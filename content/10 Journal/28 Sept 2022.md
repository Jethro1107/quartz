- Cardiovascular physiology:
    - Corresponding AV waves in JVP with the cardiac cycle:
        - V wave is caused by slow atrial filling, so maybe by nature the V wave is slower than the A wave
    - The frank-starling mechanism is a built-in mechanism that enables the heart to pump the same volume of blood that enters the right atrium
        - See Guyton: Chapter 9 and 20
