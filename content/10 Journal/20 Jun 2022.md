Pursed lip breathing (2 secs in the nose, 4 secs out pursed lips enables generation of CPAP that keeps the airway open

Respiratory examination:

Inspection - head, hands, neck, legs, chest

Hands - also observe tar staining (a sign of cigarette smoking)

Chest wall deformities - pectus excavatum, pectus carinatum, barrel chest, kyphoscoliosis

Oximetry, Peak expiratory flow meter and spirometry is also used to accompany respiratory exam

### CVS examination

JVP - biphasic wave form (AC(not seen)V)

CVS examination = Examination of arterial system (pulses), examination of venous system (JVP) + examination of the heart (precordial examination)

### General examination

Observe for syndromal features (e.g. Down’s syndrome and Marfan’s syndrome) → Reveal underlying cardiovascular abnormaliteis

Head - eyes for pallor, tongue for cyanosis

Hands - clubbing, infective endocarditis features (splinter haemorrhages, osler nodes, janeway lesions

Lower limb - pitting ankle oedema

### Examination of the pulse

Start with radial pulse

Rate and rhythm

Characteristics and volume - Collapsing pulse in radial

delay

Carotid pulse:

Characterstics and volume

### Examination of JVP

Usually not very observable in normal individuals with normal JVP

More visible in parents with pathologies

Veins vs arteries

Palpable?

Obliterated by occluding it?

Change with posture?

Affected by inspiration and expiration

Hepatojugular reflux → Coompress in liver, increasing venous return, the increase in preload increases RAP, thus increasing JVP

### Precordial examination

- Inspection
    
    Scars - axillary region or midline sternotomy
    
- Palpation
    
    Apex - locate apex beat, determine characteristics
    
    Characteristics - normal, heave (pressure overload), thrusting (volume overload), tapping (similar to thrusting, but a smaller area than thrusting)
    
    Parasternal heave (hand on sternum, put body weight, feel a force pushing on your hand)
    
    Thrills (feel in the 4 areas for palpable murmurs)
    
- Auscultation
    
    4 areas - diaphragm
    
    Mitral stenosis - bell, turn patient to the left
    
    Bibasilar crackles
