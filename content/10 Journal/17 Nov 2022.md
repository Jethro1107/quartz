- Musculoskeletal trauma
    - [[Musculoskeletal injury can be classified by energy]]
        - High energy injury, low energy injury
        - High energy injury involves high energy causes, RTA, industrial accidents
            - They tend to cause massive tissue injury
                - Injury to soft tissues
                - Comminuted fractures at multiple sites
            - Difficult to treat
            - Prevention is effective
        - Low energy injury is associated with low energy cause e.g. Falls
            - They usually cause localised tissue injury
        - Low energy energy can have high mortality as well, usually in older people

        - [[Seddon and Sunderland classification of nerve injury]]
            - Seddon and Sunderland classifies nerve injuries into 3 types:
                - Neuropraxia - Contusion in the nerve resulting in a conduction block/ Focal segmental demyelination with the axon intact
                - Axonotmesis - Axonotmesis involves discontinuity of the axon, with surrounding glial tissues (myelin sheath) intact/ demyelination with axonal and endoneurial discontinuity
                - Neurotmesis - Neurotmesis involves discontinuity of the entire nerve trunk. i.e. discontinuity in myelin sheath axon, endoneurium, perineurium and exoneurium
        - [[Wallerian degeneration preceeds healing in nerve injury with axon discontinuity]]
            - Healing after a nerve injury is complex, and largely unpredictable, depends on the type of nerve injury.
            - When there is axonal discontinuity, axonotmesis or neurotmesis:
                - When there is damage to the axon, wallerian degeneration occurs distally from the injury, while macrophages come in to clear up the cell debris
                - During the proliferation phase, healing occurs with proliferating shwann cells that regenerate the myelin tunnel. Axon sprouts and finds its way through the tunnel, at a speed of roughly 1mm per day.
            - With good apposition of the axon, full recovery is expected, but with poor apposition, a highly painful traumatic neuroma may be formed
    - Factors facilitating good bone repair:
        - Biology - Blood supply growth factors
        - Mechanical stability (Cast, external fixation, internal fixation and external traction)
        - Bone contact (reduction when necessary)
        - These underlie the principles of fracture treatment
            - Reduction when necessary ensures good bone contact
            - Stabilization (cast, external fixation, internal fixation and external traction0 provides good mechanical stability
            - Rehabilitation always
    - [[Bone repair]]
        
        
        - [[Bone repair]]
            - Bone repair occurs after injury to a bone, i.e. fracture, and initiated with inflammation
            - Inflammation stage is followed by formation of granulation tissue, and migration of fibroblast and messenchymal tissues
            - The messenchymal tissues form a fibrous and cartilaginous callus, and via endochondral ossification, forms primary bone.
            - Subsequent remodelling of primary bone into secondary bone to original bone shape.
        - Similar to the phases of healing, there are 4 phases of bone healing
            - Hematoma formation
            - Inflammation phase
            - Periosteum and endosteum cells proliferate forms a fibrocartilage tissue that bridges the fracture called a soft callus. Then via endochondral ossification, forms primary bone a hard callus.
                - The callus is normally wider than the shaft, as to provide stability.
            - Remodelling phase - Remodelled into secondary bone.

- [[Molecular basis of bone development]]
    - [[Limb development]]
        - Limbs are developed from the lateral plate mesoderm, forming buds, that extend proximodistally, forming the skeletal elements
        - During limb development, the limb is patterned in its AP axis, Proximal distal axis, and dorsal-ventral axis, which is highly regulated via different signalling pathways (a molecular control of limb outgrowth and patterning)
            - For proximodistal, it is regulated via FGF signalling
                - Stylopod (humerus), zeugopod (radius and ulna) , autopod (wrist and digit)
            - anteriorposterior patterning is regulated by sonic hedgehog signalling
            - DOrsal-ventral patterning is regulated by WNT signalling
        - 4 phases of skeletal morphogenesis
            - Migration - Mesenchymal cells migrate to epithelial cells
            - Cell interaction - Mesenchymal cells interact with the Basement membrane
            - Condensation - Mesenchymal cells condense into a ball of cells
            - Differentiation - Differentiate into osteochondroprogenitor cells and subsequently into obsteoblasts and chondrocytes
            - Differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoprogenitor cells requires early expression of SOX9 gene
                - The differentiation into osteoblasts and chondrocytes and osteoblasts is regulated by 2 genes
                    - [[Osteoblast differentiation requires activation of RUNX2]]
                        - Osteoblast differentiation required activation of RUNX2 gene (a transcription factor, a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation, as it regulates osteoblast specific genes (genes required to synthesize bone matrix), there is also participation of the the Osx gene
                            - [[Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is caused by haploinsufficiency caused by a Loss of Function mutation in [[RUNX2]] is caused by haploin]]
                                - This results in aplastic clavicles, delayed closure of cranial sutures and fontanelles, and scoliosis
                    - [[Chondrocyte differentiation requires activation of SOX9]]
                        - Chondrocyte differentiation requires activation of SOX9 (SRY-related HMG (high mobility group) box (DNA binding region) genes, where SOX9 regulates the expression of chondrocyte specific genes (genes required for synthesis of cartilage matrix, such as collagen II, IX and XI and aggrecan, in conjunction with Sox5,6
        - Limb development involves the budding of lateral plate mesoderm forming skeletal elements - Limb development occurs in a proximal-distal sequence::::
            - Cartilage is synthesized as continuous rods, and via joint initiation, form cavitations, bifurcations and segmentations, development of joint
        - [[Anteroposterior patterning (patterning of digits) is regulated by sonic hedgehog [[signalling]] ]]
            - hh sending cells are found in the zone of of polarizing region, releasing shh that functions by producing a morphogen concentration gradient, with preset values that determine different cell fates
                - Hh the morphogen, Gli complex, the downstream transcription factor
                    - Hh sending cells express a precursor, that conjugates with the cholesterol molecule at the end terminal
                        - When it is released, it is cleaved by autocatalytic activity
                    - In the absense of Hh, Ptc inhibits Smo, which results in degradation of Gli complex, resulting in repression of Hh signalling cascade
                    - Hh binds to Patched (PTc) receptor, which removes its inhibitory effect on Smothened (Smo), the transducer. Smothened when activated maintains high levels of Gli complex, which serves as an activator of Hh signalling cascade
                - Shh morphogen serves as a gradient, which cause different cell fates at different concentrations of hh. This regulates anterior posterior limb patterning, forming digits.
                    - Defects in Shh signalling pathway results in Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome increased number of digits and the digits are fused
        - [[Chondrocyte proliferation in the epiphyseal plate is regulated by FGF signalling, particularly FGF-FGFR3 signalling]]
            - FGF signals requires FGF as a morphogen, and FGFR as the receptor (tyrosine kinase receptor), and normally the outcome of this signalling pathway is mitosis, proliferationâ€¦
            - Except for FGFR 3, which inhibits proliferation, it acts as a negative regulator of chondrocyte proliferation (negative, as in contrast of the usual role of FGFR being mitogenic)
            - FGF signalling in proliferative chondrocytes
                - When FGF binds to FGFR3, with heparan sulphate proteoglycan as a co-factor, it results in dimerization and cross phosphorylation FGFR3.
                - Which phosphorylate STAT-1 into phospho STAT1
                - Phospho-STAT1 activates p21
                - ps21 is a Cdk inhibitor, inhibiting cdk 2 and 4 complexes, which inhibits cell cycle progression from G1 to S, inhibiting chondrocyte proliferation
            - [[Gain of function mutations in FGFR3 underlie Achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and Thanatophoric dysplasia]]
                - May cause stabilization of dimer
                - May cause formation of sulphide bond, or mutations in kinase domain that causes it to remain active without dimerization, both of which are ligand independent activations of FGFR
                - Muations results in activation of TK domain, increasing phosphorylation of STAT1, increasing expression of p21. This results in inhibition of Cdk-2,3 complexes, that supress cell cycle progression from G1 to S. Thus inhibiting chondrocyte proliferation, which retards bone growth via endochondral ossification.
        - [[Chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy in epiphyseal plate is regulated by the IHH PTHrP negative feedback loop]]
            - IHH/PTHrP negative feedback loop regulates the ratio between proliferating chondrocytes and hypertrophic chondrocytes, which ultimately regulate bone growth by endochondral ossification.
            - Ihh expression restricted in the prehypertrophic chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate has 2 effects:
                - Short range: Stimulates chondrocyte proliferation
                - Long range: Stimulates the expression of PTHrP in the articular cartilage.
            - PTHrP diffuses back to the epiphyseal plate and binds to the the PTH-1R and inhibits chondrocyte hypertrophy.
            - This increases the ratio between proliferating chondrocytes and hypertrophic chondrocytes.
            - When not hypertrophied, this reduces the Ihh production
