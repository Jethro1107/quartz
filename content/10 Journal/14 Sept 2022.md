- Digestion and absorption
    - Digestion refers to the chemical breakdown of ingested food into absorbable molecules (this is mediated by digestive enzymes)
    - Absorption refers to the movement of digested products from the lumen of the small intestine, into circulation (across the intestinal mucosa)
- Digestion and absorption of carbohydrates
    - Digestion of carbohydrates - It starts from the oral cavity to the small intestine
        - Digestion in the mouth cavity
            - Salivary glands release alpha-amylase, which cleaves the alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds between 2 glucose molecules in a polysaccharide chain (not the alpha-1,4 glycosidic bond present between glucose molecules within maltoseâ€¦ cannot cleave terminal alpha-1,4 glycosidic bond)
            - The resultant products are maltose, maltotriose, isomaltose and alpha-dextrin
