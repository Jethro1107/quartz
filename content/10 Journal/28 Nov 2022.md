    - Big data
        - Autonomy - problem of consent (Opt out system?), is it an informed consent?, Confidentiality
        - Non maleficience - Continuous monitoring and privacy, big brother influence and discrimination, security and potential commercial exploitation, big data quality and integrity
        - Justice - Widening the health divide
            - Global - use of big data wide the health divide
            - Local - is it the best use of resource
    - Transplant ethics
        - Related topics: Cadeveric donation, Donation from live donors, transplant tourism
        - Hong Kong system of cadeveric donation:
            - An opt in system, one of the lowest rates of organ donation
            - An important barrier is that despite an individual has specifically expressed willingness to donate, the family of the disease still need to sign a consent form, i.e. family members have the last say

    - Autonomy
        - Informed consent for use of dota
            - Need to understand how AI work (sufficient info), free of coersion and has the mental capacity to do so
            - Is there an option to opt out
        - Physician authority
            - Can it undermine clinical authority
            - Automation bias (physician may lose their free will in decision making)
            - How can physicial endorse a treatment recommendation generated by an algorithm if u can’t explain the rationale
        - Consent to extraneous data use?
    - Non-maleficence
        - Data security and exploitation
        - Hacks may result in data leakage

- Big data and the quest for precision medicine [[Big data in healthcare and its ethical concerns]]
    - Big data in healthcare: high volume, moves at high velocity, with many sources, and highly variable in structure and nature. A corner stone to precision medicine.
    - Ethics in Big data for research and DTC
        - Autonomy:
            - Consent
                - Unsure if informed consent is practicable
                - Opt in
                - Opt out system
                - Broad consent is recognised for bio-banking
            - Confidentiality
        - Non-maleficence
            - Continuous monitoring promotes better self management
            - Extraneous findings
            - Security and exploitation
                - Accidental data leaks or data sales
        - Justice
            - Widening the health divide
- Precision medicine
    - The promise of treating the right patient, with the right treatment, at the right dpose, at the right time for the right outcome.
    - Advantages
        - Reduced morbidity and mortality with personalised treatments
        - Earlier diagnosis
        - Better targeting of resources
        - Cost saving

    - Living donation
        - organ transplant from a living, healthy individual to another dude in dire need of the organ
        - Current laws from living donation
            
            ![[Untitled 1]]
            
            An act of altruism, no economic incentive
            
        - An important issue with living donation: organ sales and transplant tourism
        - Ethical concerns of organ sales and transplant tourism
            - Autonomy
                - Family obligation, arranged marriages, reciprocal obligation, children?
                - One has the autonomy to make the choice sell their organs
                    - But is it truely voluntary if desperate to sell?
            - Beneficence:Non-maleficence
                - Very complex assessment for a multitude of reasons:
                    - Most importantly, can’t guarantee the quality of transplant/quality of donor organ/will the dude reject the organ
                    - 1 harm + 1 saved vs 1 dead
                    - Long term morbidity and risks is unclear
                - For organ sales, the fact is, the donors usually receive suboptimal care (exploitation)
