- Microbiology practical: Enteric infections
    - Throat swab and rectal swab uses the same swab for collecting samples
    - Getting the best sample (concept of garbage in, garbage out)
        - Best sample type for enteric infections are stool samples
        - Rectal swab as a surrogate for stool samples, in cases where stool samples are unavailable
        - Rectal swabs should be stained with faeces, must ins-Soribiert far enough into the rectum
        - Rectal swabs are routinely performed a rectal swab, even assymptomatic, as need to know whether they are colonised by multi-drug resistance bugs
            - Particular criteria, recent admission in another hostpital, travel history etc. read up
        - Viral transport medium, recall from [[IAS63  Medically Important Viruses ]] the viral cause of GE
            - Viral transport medium contains - pH indicator
            - Now rarely put stool in viral transport medium as make use of molecular dx, e.g. PCR
        - Stool is full of shitâ€¦ billions of bacteria (with high diversity, mainly anaerobes)
            - Aetiological diagnosis is like finding a needle in a haystack
            - How do you identify etiological bacteria?
                - Selective agar - Maconkey agar (selects gram negative, inhibits the growth of gram positive)
                - Differential agar - bad bugs stand out. Sorbitol agar (differentiate Haemorrhagic O157 E. coli), CCDA in a microaerophilic environment (differentiate campylobacter), Chromid c. Difficile agar
                - Stool is put on a number of selective or differential agars (a panel of agar plates) to isolate the pathogens
                - Maconkey, sorbitol Maconkey, XLD (differentiate salmonella)
            - Salmonella serotyping
                - Typhoidal vs paratyphoidal A, B, C
                - Serotyping (use of  serum Ab)  - Widal test
                    - Use a panel of antiserum/antigen and see which one has agglutination (formation of Ab/Ag complex)
                    - The panel of antigens consist of O and H antigens, if there are agglutination, Ab is presence in serum against that particular antigen, that means that antigen is present in body
                    - Kauffman-White scheme (not important)
                - Shigella
                    - Mainly use biochemical reactions, as they are not distinctive in Mackonkey and XLD
                - TCBS agars used for differentiating **Vibros**
                    - Yellow (fermenting sucrose) - Cholerae
                    - Green (non-fermenters of sucrose) - Parahaemolyticus
                    - Vibros are curved robs
                - Important differentials for fever after travel
                    - Meningococcal mengtitis (neisseria meningitidis)
                    - Malaria
                    - Salmonella typhi Diarrhoea (Typoidal fever/enteric fever)
                    - Dengue
                    - Zika
                    - Leptospirosis
- Pancreatic secretions
    - Acinar cells produce an isotonic, H+ rich fluid with digestive enzymes
        - Inactive zymogens (trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, procarboxypeptidase) involved in protein digestion
        - Active enzymes - Amylase, lipase, cholesteryl esterase, phospholipase, RNAase and DNAase
    - Secretory vesicles in acinar cells are highly acidified
        - This acidic microenvironment is created by vesicular H+-ATPase, which pumps in H+ into the vesicles at the expense of ATP.
        - There is physiological significance of H+ in secretory vesicles
            - H+ released into the lumen causes the pH of the lumen to drop, this activates plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA), which pumps out Ca2+ in exchange for luminal H+. This results in a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ levels., inhibiting acinar cell secretion.
    - Secretion of isotonic fluid by acinar cells is mediated by an ionic mechanism
        - Basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase creates a Na+ gradient
        - Basolateral Na+/HCO3- cotransporter (pNBC1) cotransports Na+ with HCO3- into acinar cells down the Na+ gradient
        - As HCO3- accumulates, basolateral AE2 pumps out HCO3- in exchange for interstitial Cl-.
        - Upon stimulation, activation of apical membrane Ca2+ activated Cl- channels, which pumps out the Cl-.
        - This rseults in a negative potential and osmotic gradient to the lumen, driving Na+ and water movement into the lumen, creating an isotonic fluid with Na+, Cl- and H2O
- Pancreatic ductal cell produces an isotonic, HCO3- rich fluid
    
    This is mediated by 2 mechanisms
