- [[Chronic illness]]
    - Umbrella term that describes a condition that requires ongoing, long term care
        - Caused by an irreversible pathological change
    - Increasing prevalance of chronic illness due to:
        - Population aging - predominant in old individuals
        - Better medical care - Better emergency treatments increase survival from acute illness or trauma. Also availability of health screening
        - Change in lifestyle - increase sedentary time, unhealthy diet
        - Change in environment, e.g. pollution
    - Chronic illness is associated with some degree of [[Impairment and disability]]
        - Disability definition
            - Defined as any condition of the body or mind (impairment) that makes it more difficult for the person with the condition to do certain activities (activity limitation), and interact with the world around them (participation restriction)
            - Disability requires an impairment, that results in activity limitation and participation restriction
            - But impairment need not to result in activity limitation, or participation restriction. Social and politcal factors determine the built environment that determines whether an impairment becomes a disability
    - From the patients perspective, what does it mean to be chronically ill?
        - Managing medical regimens
            - In outpatient setting, requires them to learn how to manage symptoms and manifestations
            - Learn new skills and gain useful information in managing their chronic illness.
            - Challenge is compliance:
                - Overwhelmed by the life-long commitment
                - Interferes with job
        - Biographical disruption
        - Disruption of family and social life
            - Change in family roles and relationships
            - Strains on family member due to provision of high level of care and support
            - Withdrawal from key social roles
            - Social isolation
        - Uncertainty

        MSS Microbiology Practical 1
        
        Pyoderma - Pyogenic infection of the skin
        
        ```
        - Erisypelas - Well demarcated pinkish/red lesion
        - Impetigo
        - Cellulitis
        - Folliculitis etc.
        - Gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis) - Many gas formation during infection
        	- Clinical suspicion arises with subcutaneous emphysema (tiny gas pockets under skin), and very severe systemic manifestations, almost septic.
        	- Dx by culture, radiological, microscopy - G+ box like bacilli, but no WBC, as they killed by toxinss
        	- Virulence factor - lots of toxins, esp. Alpha toxins
        	- Read the practical slides
        
        ```
        
        ### Case 1
        
        - Scabies (read up, not covered), very common in elderly, hospital, community acquired, and quite infective, can infect healthcare workers
        - *Sarcoptes scabiei*
        - Manifestation:
        - Most important itchiness, as they lay eggs and shit and cause inflammation
            - Burrows - Serpiginous tract under skin (sometimes)
            - Red papules more common
            - Crusted scabies manifests as hyperkeratotic
        - Transmission - Direct contact, but not easily transmitted
        - Mx - topical scabies cream? Permethrin, Benzyl benzoate emulsion, Malathion (insecticide)
        
        ### Case 2
        
        - S&S: Manifestation in skin and skin appendages, time course: 3months, chronic, probably not bacterial
        - Dx: Dermatophytosis
        - yeast or mould - On culture, yeast looks like bacterial colonies, obverse and reverse side may look different in some moulds
        - Dermatophytes - Trichophyton (Trichophyton rugrum), Epidermophyton, Microsporum
        
        ### Case 3
        
        - necrotising fasciitis, hemorrhagic bullae a typical sign, dusky discolouration as well, no feel when touching lesion
    - Gas gangrene was the focus on the topic, lets add more details to [[Necrotising soft tissue infections]]:
        - Clostridium myonecrosis, gas gangrene is a toxin mediated disease:
            - Alpha toxin - A lecithinase (phospholipase C), lyses erythrocyte, platelets and leukocytes (hence no leukocytes on gram stain). Causes massive haemolysis, increased vascular permeability, bleeding and tissue destruction. Plays the bulk of role in manifestation of gas gangrene
            - Beta toxin, Epsilon toxin and enterotoxins play more of a role in GI infections
    - [[Scabies]]
        - *Sarcoptes scabiei*
        - Clinical features
            - Erythromatous papules and burrows
            - Pruritis (itchiness) - as eggs laid triggers inflammation
        - Epidemiology
            - Direct contact transmission, incubation usually 3-4 weeks
            - Commonly affects elderly?
            - very common in elderly, hospital, community acquired, and quite infective, can infect healthcare workers
        - Dx
            - Clinical diagnosis by presentation
            - Skin scrapings in KOH wet mount
        - Treatment
            - Permithrin, benzyl benzoate emulsion
    - [[Clostridium tetani]]
        - Prototypical toxin mediated infection
        - Etiology
            - Clostridium tetani anaerobic g+ bacilli, spore forming
        - Pathogenesis
            - Soil and GI tract, enters body through wounds
        - Tx
        - Prevention
        - Childhood immunization
- learnt quite a lot of clostridium infections in gis and mss (theme?)

Darrens definition of nonsense and missense mutations:

non-sense and missense are both point mutations
Missense - cause substitution of different amino acid
Non-sense - introduce stop codon, terminates the peptide chain so disrupts protein

- Diagnosis 101
    - Like how screening is the pressumptive identification of an unrecognised disease in an otherwise healthy individual in the application of tests, examinations and procedures, Diagnosis also applies test
    - Diagnosis is not pressumptive, but definitive. It is defined as the process of determining health status and the factors responsible for producing it.
    - While u apply “diagnostic tests” when u want to make a definitive diagnosis, different diagnostic tests are built different, and thus have different functions:
        - A test with high positive LR (>10) is used to make a definitive diagnosis.
        - A test with low LR- (<0.1) is used to rule out a diagnosis
    - LR describes the performance of test
        - [[Chemical pathology]] notes has a section with LR
        - A function of SN and SP
    - How is LR applied: post-test odds
        - Pre-test **odds (requires conversion to odds)** - by prevalence
        - Pretest times likelihood ratio = post-test odds
    - Diagnosis with multiple tests
        - As multiple tests may be required due to intermediate LRs and predictive values:
            - Parallel testing increases sensitivity and negative predictive values, but increases FP
            - Serial testing increases specificity and positive predictive values, but increases FN

        Inception cohort - cohort identified and assembled for subsequent study at an early and uniform point in the course of the specific health condition (soon after dx, or early after onset of symptoms)
        
        - This prevents selection bias caused by early death or early recovery of some patients
    - Outcome studied:
        - Mortality
            - Can be extracted from misclassification
            - All cause
            - disease-specific mortality - prone to misclassification
