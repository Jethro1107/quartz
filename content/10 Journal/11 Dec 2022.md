- [[Trochlear nerve (CN IV)]]
	- Course
		- Trochlear nerve is the only cranial nerve emerging from the dorsal side of the brainstem, emerging inferior to the inferior colliculus
		- It immediately decussate and emergs forward through the middle cranial fossa and inferior to the carveneous sinus, as enters the Oribital canal through the superior orbital fissure
	- Functions and functional component
		- Somatic motor component, providing motor innervation to the superior oblique muscle
		- Enables intorsion, depression of adducted eye
	- Trochlear nerve nuclei
		- Trochlear nerve nuclei is located anterior to the periaqueductal gray in the midbrain, at the level of the inferior colliculus
	- Defects
		- Diplopia (double vision)
		- Extorsion of eye (deviating outward)- compensated by head tilt to unaffected side
		- Weakness of depression of adducted eye
- [[Abducens nerve (CN VI)]]
	- Course
		- Abducens nerve emerges from the junction of the pons and medulla
		- Passes through the carveneous sinus, and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure.
	- Functions
		- Somatic motor component, responsible for motor innervation of lateral rectus muscle
		- Abduction of eye
	- Defects
		- Diplopia
		- Medial deviation of eye
		- Failure to abduct the affected eye
- [[Trigeminal nerve (CN V)]]
	- Course
		- The trigeminal nerve emerges from the lateral side of the pons, and pass forward out of the posterior cranial fossa and rests on the upper surface of the petrous part of the temoral bone in the middle cranial fossa. It enters the trigeminal ganglion, and divides into the opthalmic, maxillary and mandibular divisions.
		- The opthalmic division is sensory, and pases into the orbit through the superior orbital fissure
		- The maxillary nerve passes through the foramen rotundum
		- The mandibular nerve leaves the skull through the foramen ovale
	- Functions and functional components
		- Somatic sensory component: Somatosensation to the mucous membranes and skin of face and head, muscles of mastication, peridontal membrane, temporomandibular joint, external ocular muscles
		- Branchial motor component: to muscles of mastication
- [[Thalamus]] ^1c94ad
	- Two ovoid masses of gray matter that forms the major mass of the diencephalon, situated on each side of the 3rd ventricle
	- Anterior end is narrow and round, the posterior end is expanded to form the pulvinar, which overlies the superior colliculus of the midbrain
	- Two thalamus are jointed by the interthalamic adhesion
	- Function of the thalamus,a centre to relay all sensory signals to the cortex, controlling the perception of touch, pressure, temperature. It is also involved in movement control.
	- Location
		- Anteriorly bordered by the interventricular foramen, posteriorly by pulvinar
		- Superiorly bordered by stratum zonale (white matter) and stria terminalis
		- Inferiorly, hypothalamus
		- Medially, lateral wall of 3rd ventricle
		- Laterally, nerve fibres of internal capsules
	- Thalamic nuclei
