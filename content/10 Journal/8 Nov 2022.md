- Junquiera is a must read for understanding bone structure, remodelling and repair
- Skeletal system
    - Components: Bones and joints of the body and their associated cartilage
    - At birth, an individual consist of 206 bones, but number varies with age, and from individual to individual.
        - Bones may fuse as we age, also, sessamoid bones may develop once tendons are under stress
    - 2 Divisions
        - Axial skeleton - Skull, auditory ossicles, hyoid bone, chest wall
        - Appendicular skeleton - Bones of the upper and lower limb, including the pectoral girdle and the pelvic girdle
    - [[5 types of bones by shape]]
        - Long bone - Length relatively longer than width
        - Short bones - length similar to width
        - Flat bones - Flat surface. It hosts marrow cavity, holding marrow for blood production
        - Irregular bones - Sphenoid bone, vertebral body. Consist of foramens, and grooves for conveying different structure. Provides many surfaces for muscle attachment.
    - Bones are the hardest tissue in the body - Mineralised tissue
        - They withstand stress
        - Provide support to neurovascular structures
        - Axial skeleton offers protection to internal organs
        - Bones forms joints that provide a system of liver for muscle attachment, providing locomotion and movement of the limbs
        - Reservoir of Ca2+ and PO43-
        - Harbors bone marrow - Haematopoiesis
- [[Bone tissue]]
    - Bone tissue is a highly specialised connective tissue with ************mineralised************ extracellular matrix, the ***********bone matrix*********** and 3 cell types:
        - [[Osteoblast]] osteum - Responsible for synthesis of organic matrix
            - Osteoblast is responsible for laying down bone by synthesizing the organic matrix osteoid, which primarily consist of type 1 collagen, some proteoglycans and glycoproteins. They are also involved in providing the right minerals for osteoid calcification. The production of osteoid overlying the existing bone matrix underlies the mechanism of appositional growth.
            - They assume a protein-synthesizing phenotype: Prominent golgi, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and hence are highly basophilic
            - When active, they have cuboidal to columnar shape, basophilic cytoplasm, and high alkaline phosphatase activity, provides phosphate for mineralisation of osteoid
            - When inactive, cells become squamous, low alkaline phosphatase. 3 months of inactivity, become bone lining cells.
            - They are derived from osteoprogenitor cells in the periosteum and endosteum, and lines the bone surfaces. Osteoprogenitor cells in turn is derived from circulation.
        - [[Osteocyte]]  - Found in lacunae surrounded by lamellae of bone matrix
            - Once osteoblasts are surrounded by the osteoid it synthesize, it becomes osteocytes, and are present in cavities of the bone matrix called lacunae, surrounded by the bone matrix it produces.
            - Osteocytes produce cytosolic processes to maintain contact with adjacent osteocytes forming the cannaliculi in the matrix, i.e. An osteocyte and its process occuplies the lacunae and cannaliculi radiating from it.
            - These cell contact enables communication and nutrition in a chain of up to 10 osteocytes.
            - Osteocytes are incapable of division, but have a half life of 25 years, they are involved in maintainence of surrounding bone matrix. Death of osteocytes will result in resorption of the surrounding bone matrix.
        - [[Osteoclast]] - Responsible for resorption and remodelling of bone tissue
            - Osteoclasts can be considered as a bone macrophage.
            - Large multinucleated mobile cells derived from the fusion of circulating monocytes (mononuclear phagocyte system). They attach to the bone surface and resorb bone.
                - The ruffled border faces the bone matrix increases surface area for bone resorption
                - A clear cytoplasmic zone is the region of cytoplasm that surrounds the ruffle borders, it is an isolated microenvironment for osteolytic activity.
                - At the subcellular pocket, it secrets collagenase, acid (protons), and other proteolytic enzymes for the degradation of hydroxyapatite crystals and breakdown of type 1 collagen of the bone matrix.
            - The osteoclastic activity leaves a bony depression Howship’s lacunae, where osteoclasts sit in
        - [[Periosteum and endosteum]]
            - They are the membrane lining the bone matrix externally and internally
            - Periosteum
                - Outler layer of collagen and fibroblast (fibrous layer)
                - Inner cellular layer of osteoprogenitor cells derived from circulation, which differentiate into osteoblasts for synthesis of osteoids by appositional growth
                - Sharpey’s fibres, bundles of periosteal collagen fibres, penetrate the bone matrix, anchoring periosteum to the bone matrix.
            - Endosteum
                - Lines the marrow cavity
                - Thin connective tissue with osteoprogenitor cells
        - Bone matrix
            - The bone matrix 50% of dry mass - inorganic material - hydroxyapatite is most abundant, but other minerals only present.
            - Organic matrix - 90% type 1 collagen, proteoglycans and adhesive glycoproteins, e.g. osteonectin.
