- [[Histology of the GI tract]]
    - [[The common histological layers of the GI tract]]
        - Histologically, different parts of the GI tract share the same four histological layers: 1) Mucosa, 2) Submucosa, 3) Muscularis externa and 4) Serosa/Adventitia.
        - Features of the mucosa
            - The mucosa is lined with an **epithelium** - The epithelium starts as a non-karatinised stratified squamous epithelium in the oesophagus (to protect against abraisions), which abruptly changes into a simple columnar epithelium at the stomach (for absorption and secretion functions).
            - Underneath the epithelium, is the **lamina propria** - The lamina propria is a loose connective tissue consisting of small blood vessels, lymphatics and small glands
            - **Muscularis mucosae** - A thin layer of longitudinally-arranged smooth muscle that separates the mucosa and the submucosa
        - Features of the submucosa
            - The submucosa is formed mainly by a dense irregular connective, consisting of larger blood vessels and lymphatics
            - The submucosa also consist of the submucosal (Meissner) plexus, which are nerve fibres of the autonomic nervous system. The Meissner plexus regulates secretomotor functions, regulating secretion of mucosal glands and motility of the muscularis mucosae
            - **Mucous glands** are only present in the oesophagus (as oesophageal glands) and in the duodenum (as duodenal glands).
        - Features of the muscularis externa
            - The muscularis externa is a thick muscularis of smooth muscles organised into two sublayers:
                - Inner circular muscles (ICM) - The inner sublayer where fibres orientation is circular, i.e. perpendicular to the direction of the GI tract
                - Outer longitudinal muscles (OLM) - The outer sublayer where fibres orientation are longitudinal, i.e. perpendicular to the direction of the GI tract
            - Between the two sublayers, is the myenteric (Auerbach) plexus, consisting of autonomic neurons organised into nerve ganglia and interconnected pre- and post-ganglionic nerve fibres. The Auerbach plexus regulates motor functions, coordinating the contraction of the muscularis externa to mix food and push it down the GI tract, i.e. Peristalsis.
            - Note that the Meissner and Auerbach plexus comprise the *enteric nervous system.*
        - Features of the serosa/adventitia
            - Serosa - A thin layer of loose connective tissue covered by a layer of simple squamous epithelium (mesothelium), which is the parietal peritoneum in gross anatomy. Only intraperitoneal organs are covered by the serosa.
            - Adventitia - A thick layer of connective tissue with no mesothelial lining that is continuous with surrounding tissue. Only the oesophagus (as it is not located in the abdominal cavity) and retroperitoneal organs are covered by the adventitia.
    - Histology of the oesophagus
        - The oesophagus also pocess the 4 histological layers of the GI tract
        - Features of the mucosa of the oesophagus
            - Made of non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium, which provides protection against abraision when delivering the bolus down the oesophagus
            - There is nothing distinct about the lamina propria and the muscularis mucosae in the oesophagus
        - Features of the submucosa of the oesophagus
            - Consist of submucosal glands, oesophageal glands, that are responsible for mucus secretion.
        - Features of the muscularis externa of the oesophagus
            - Different segments of the muscularis externa of the oesophagus consist of different muscle types:
                - The upper 1/3 - is made of pure skeletal muscles
                - The middle 1/3 - consist of a mix of skeletal muscles and smooth muscles
                - The lower 1/3 - is made of pure smooth muscles
            - Note that 2 sublayers can still be seen in the oesophagus, with the myenteric plexus in between the two.
        - Features of the serosa/adventita of the oesophagus
            - The oesophagus is mainly surrounded by adventitia, which is continuous with other tissue in the mediastinum
            - Only the distal part of the oesophagus (after entering the abdominal cavity via the oesophageal hiatus) is lined with serosa.
    - Histology of the stomach
        - Anatomy of the stomach
            - The stomach is a greatly dilated segment of the GI tract that pocesses 4 regions:
                1. Cardia - A short, narrow transitional zone from the oesophagus to the stomach
                2. Fundus - The superior gas-filled portion of the stomach (the upper dome) 
                3. Body - the large portion of the stomach
                4. Pylorus - the distal, funnel-shaped part of the stomach that empties into the duodenum
                
                The mucosa and submucosa of the stomach forms longitudinal folds (gastric rugae) in an empty stomach, enabling the stomach to distend when filled with food.
                
        - Histology of the stomach
            - Features of the mucosa of the stomach
                - The stomach is lined with a simple columnar epithelium which invaginates into the lamina propria to form gastric pits and gastric glands
                - There is nothing distinct about lamina propria and muscularis mucosae
            - Features of the submucosa of the stomach
                - Together with mucosa, they form longitudinal folds (gastric rugae in an empty stomach). The significance of this is not to increase surface area for absorption (as the stomach is not the main site of absorption), but to enabling the stomach to distend without an increase in pressure.
            - Features of the muscularis externa of the stomach
                - The muscularis externa of the stomach consist of 3 sublayers: 1) Innermost oblique muscles, 2) inner circular muscles and 3) outer longitudinal muscles.
                - The additional innermost oblique muscles may not be seen in certain sections.
                - The thickness of the inner circular muscle layer thickens at the pylorus, forming a major part of the stomach.
            - Features of the serosa of the stomach
                - Nothing distinct, but note that the stomach is lined with serosa rather than adventitia.

    - **Notes from 4 Sept**
    - Review of the bones that lie above, behind and below the abdominal cavity
        - Superiorly, bordered by the costal margin
        - Diaphragm forms the upper limit of the abdominal cavity
        - Posteriorly, lumber vertebrae, forms the bony framework of the posterior abdominal wall
        - Inferiorly, upper part of the bone of the pelvis
    - Layers of muscles and tendon that form the abdominal wall
        - Posterior abdominal muscles, along with lumbar vertebrae, and the diaphragm forms the posterior abdominal wallâ€¦ These muscles include the erector spinae muscle, the quadratus lumborum, the psoas major and the iliacus
            - Erector spinae muscle
                - Originates from the posterior part of the iliac crest and attaches along the posterior part of the vertebral column and the ribs
                - Surrounded by the thoracolumbar fascia
            - Quadratus lumborum
                - Originates from 12th rib and transverse process of the first 3 lumbar vertebrae
                - Inserts at the medial end of the iliac crest and transverse process of L5

            - Psaos and iliacus
                - Psaos lies medial to the quadratus lumborum, and lies lateral to the vertebral column

                ![[Untitled 1]]
                
                - It originates from the transverse processes and intervertebral disc of lumbar vertebrae, and proceeeds inferolaterally and anteriorly along the pelvic brim
                - The iliacus lies lateral to the inferior part of the psaos major, where it originates from the iliac fossa and proceeds towards the inguinal canal
                
                ![[Untitled 1]]
                
                - The iliacus and the psaos major fuse together to form the iliopsaos, where it passes below the inguinal ligament and attaches to the lesser trochanter of the femur
                - The iliac and psaos is covered by the iliopsaos fascia, which is covered by the parietal peritoneum
                - The iliac and psaos functions to flexion of the hip joint
